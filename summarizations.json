Conveniently, Prime Day fitness tracker deals (all four days of them) drop right in the middle of summer, which makes this a great time to pick up the smartwatch or smart ring that you just didn't have the cash for at Christmas.\n\nThis year, you have four whole days to shop the Amazon deals, but if you don't want to take that much time, I've highlighted the sales on some of our favorite fitness trackers and smart rings. Not a subscriber yet? Perhaps our list of the best Amazon Prime Perks can convince you to sign up. Deal hunters should also check out our Best Amazon Prime Day Deals roundup and Prime Day liveblog.\n\nUpdated July 10, 2025: We've added new deals on the Fitbit Inspire 3, Samsung Galaxy Watch7, and the Polar H10.\n\nWIRED Featured Deals\n\nFitness Tracker Deals\n\nThe Best Smart Ring\n\nAs you might expect with my job, I am frequently asked what fitness tracker to get, and this year, more often than not, I have told people to just buy an Oura Ring 4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) . You don't have to wear it on your wrist, the battery life is longer than most trackers, and Oura issues interesting, meaningful software updates regularly. This is the first time it's gone on sale, and you should get it.\n\nA Continuous Glucose Monitor\n\nOf all the fitness trackers that I've tested this year, none has inspired as many questions as a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). You click the sensor on your arm and a tiny sensor reads the glucose in your interstitial fluid. When you eat something that spikes your blood sugar, like, oh, a cookie, you get an alert on your phone saying, \u201cNo! Don't do that!\u201d If you're pre-diabetic or dealing with a health condition, you're probably very interested in getting one. Abbott is currently offering 9-15 percent off the sensors.\n\nThe Best Fitness Tracker\n\nFitbit has faced pretty stiff competition over the years (most notably from the Apple Watch), but its flagship Charge line is still the best overall fitness tracker for the money. Even tracking multiple activities a day, the battery lasts over a week. The updated app looks great, and multiple Google integrations make the Fitbit Charge 6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) easier to use than ever.\n\nThe Best If You Have an iPhone\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 is the best fitness tracker for iPhone users. It still doesn't have blood oxygen sensing due to a patent dispute, but it's otherwise a solid fitness tracker. The standout feature is sleep apnea notifications. The watch uses an accelerometer and machine learning to check if you have breathing disturbances at night. The Series 10 is also thinner, lighter, easier to wear, and charges faster than previous models.\n\nThe Best Analog Fitness Tracker\n\nBefore I even started this job, I had purchased the original Withings Steel HR, which was the first of Withings' gorgeous fitness trackers that don't even look like regular fitness trackers. The Scanwatch 2 follows in that tradition with a comprehensive suite of health features and Withings' new cardiac-focused health features, like Cardio Check-Up, which lets you send your cardiac data instantly to Withings' board of certified cardiologists.\n\nThe Best Kids\u2019 Watch\n\nI have personally convinced many parents in my life to buy the Fitbit Ace LTE (7/10, WIRED Recommends) for their kids. It's a Fitbit, so it works even if one parent is Android and the other is Apple (if so, why?), and the $10/month subscription includes data, so you don't need to fuss with adding service to your cell plan. Fitbit Arcade incentivizes my kids to keep their watches on and charged, and I like Google's included kids' safety features.\n\nBest Ring for Samsung Fans\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Ring (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is slim and lightweight, with decent sleep tracking, the ability to auto-detect workouts, and accurate cycle and heart rate tracking. You need a Samsung watch or phone to take full advantage, but Samsung's devices are slick when used together.\n\nA Great Garmin\n\nGarmin is known for its Forerunner series of running watches. The Forerunner 255 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the older version of the Forerunner 265 that we recommend in our roundup, but Garmins age well, and the older version does have some features to recommend it over the newer one, like better battery life.\n\nThe Cheapest Tracker You Should Buy\n\nIt may be cheap, but the Amazfit Active 2 (6/10, WIRED Reviewed) is no slouch on the sensor front with a photo plethysmography (PPG) sensor, accelerometer, gyroscope, barometric altimeter, ambient light, and temperature sensor to track your sleep, heart rate, and blood oxygen saturation. It also boasts tons of workout modes, long battery life, and 5 ATM water resistance.\n\nThe Most Affordable Apple Watch\n\nWhile it's not the most exciting Apple watch, the SE series is the cheapest way to try out an Apple fitness tracker. The SE uses watchOS 11, which can connect to the Vitals app, which makes it easy to check your heart rate and respiration in a dashboard without hunting through the Health or Fitness apps. It has the last S8 chip, which is what the Series 8 has, and features like Crash Detection to call your emergency contact and emergency responders if you've been in a car accident. The SE series doesn't have the latest health features, like the ability to check your skin temperature, and the display is noticeably smaller than Apple's other options, but for the price this is hard to beat, especially on sale.\n\nSamsung's Flagship Smartwatch\n\nSamsung\u2019s flagship smartwatch is a no-brainer for folks in Samsung\u2019s ecosystem. The Galaxy Watch Ultra boasts dual-band GPS, excellent health and activity monitoring features, and two-day battery life. It's tough, too, with a titanium case and 10 ATM/IP68 ratings. Samsung announced a newer version of the Galaxy Watch Ultra, but it's actually the same watch with 64 GB of storage and a new color, so it's smart to snag this one for half its MSRP.\n\nA No-Subscription Smart Ring\n\nWhile the Oura Ring 4 is undoubtedly the champion of smart rings, you'll be paying $8 a month if you want the full experience. The Ultrahuman Ring Air (7/10, WIRED Recommends), though, comes with an included \u201clifetime subscription,\u201d meaning you'll have full access to your data and analytics when you pick one of these up. It's the first time the price has dropped this low too, so if ever there was a time, it's now.\n\nThe Cheapest Fitbit\n\nHere's proof that reliable tracking doesn't have to be expensive. The standout feature of the Fitbit Inspire 3 is its incredibly long battery life. We're talking up to 10 days! The teeny, tiny AMOLED screen is super bright, making it easy to see your stats despite its tiny size.\n\nA Stylish Garmin\n\nMost Garmin watches aren't likely to win any beauty prizes\u2014they're chunky, with an emphasis on the technical over aesthetic. The Lily 2 is the exception. It's Garmin that looks more like, well, a nice watch. You can even get it with a leather band. It's one of the smallest Garmins and battery life is on the short side\u2014three to four days. But it has a Pulse Ox sensor, a beautiful Corning Gorilla Glass lens, a metal bezel, and standard Garmin features like Body Battery and fall detection.\n\nThe Best Wear OS Smartwatch\n\nSlick looks, Fitbit integration, and bags of features, the Google Pixel Watch 3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best Wear OS watch for folks with an Android phone. It's no slouch as a health and fitness tracker, with electrocardiogram readings, sleep tracking, heart rate readings, blood-oxygen measurements, and stress tracking.\n\nThe Best for Samsung Phones\n\nSamsung phone owners should consider this wearable as it offers excellent health and fitness tracking and some exclusive features that only work when paired with a Samsung phone, such as FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection. It's a great discount but that's partly because the new one has just arrived.\n\nFor Serious Health Tracking\n\nIt might be a little long in the tooth, but the Fitbit Sense 2 is probably still the best for serious health tracking and the closest to a competitor for the Apple Watch. It has ECG functionality, and can track your stress. There's also built-in GPS, an SpO2 sensor, and a skin temperature sensor, too.\n\nThe Best Heart Rate Monitor\n\nWhile fitness trackers generally have built-in heart rate monitors, a separate strap on your bicep or around your chest is far more accurate when things get sweaty and intense during a tough workout. Polar's strap has a comfortable buckle connector and silicone dots to keep it in place.\n\nA Smart Scale\n\nIf you still have a humble bathroom scale, it may be time to upgrade to one that has fancy new tricks, like tracking your vascular age and visceral fat. The Withings Body Comp connects directly to the Withings app (so you don't need to have your phone nearby) and shows a staggering amount of data, everything from your weight to muscle mass, heart rate, pulse wave velocity, and weird things like the air quality and your body water percentage."}, "https://www.wired.com/story/ftc-click-to-cancel-rule-killed-consumer-advocates-could-revive-it/": {"title": "The \u2018Click-to-Cancel\u2019 Rule Was Killed, but Consumer Advocates Could Revive It", "summary": "The Federal Trade Commission's \"Click to Cancel\" rule was unanimously struck down by the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit on Tuesday. States-level rules already have started to step in with more consumer protections than what\u2019s currently offered at the federal level.", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/ftc-click-to-cancel-rule-killed-consumer-advocates-could-revive-it/", "content": "United States residents almost escaped subscription cancellation hell, but the Federal Trade Commission's \u201cClick to Cancel\u201d rule was unanimously struck down by the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit on Tuesday\u2014just days before it was set to go into effect.\n\nWhat would have happened if this updated FTC rule had gone into effect on July 14 as planned? \u201cThe stated goal was that they wanted to make it as easy for you to cancel a subscription as it is to sign up,\u201d says John Breyault, vice president of public policy, telecommunications, and fraud at the National Consumers League. How reasonable! It\u2019s the type of rule that sounds like it should already exist as part of baseline consumer protections.\n\nIf I can sign up for a gym membership or a news website subscription or a food delivery service with just a few seamless taps on my smartphone, then why am I so often thrown into a labyrinth of puzzles\u2014with people to call or in-person locations to visit\u2014whenever I want to opt out from one of the recurring subscription charges. Even services that do allow users to cancel online may include more steps than the sign-up process or introduce confusingly labeled buttons that slow the process.\n\nThe Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision to nix the Click to Cancel rule was based on procedural complaints, not on the substance of what the consumer protections entailed. \u201cWhile we certainly do not endorse the use of unfair and deceptive practices in negative option marketing, the procedural deficiencies of the Commission\u2019s rulemaking process are fatal here,\u201d reads the appeal court\u2019s published opinion.\n\nJohn Davisson, director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, sees this decision as \u201cvery poorly reasoned\u201d and hopes the current FTC tries to revisit the rule to protect consumers better.\n\n\u201cIt would be such a slam dunk for the commission,\u201d says Davisson. \u201cI think everyone understands why the subscription traps are bad. No one without a financial incentive or career advancement motive to sustain these subscription traps thinks they should exist.\u201d\n\nA broad base of support from individual consumers for streamlining the opt out process could help eventually revive the Click to Cancel rule or similar consumer protections.\n\n\u201cI'm somewhat hopeful, given the public support for this important option of canceling, that the commission will go back and get this thing re-going again,\u201d says Bill Baer, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution and former member of the FTC. \u201cIt'll take some time, but it's an important benefit to consumers.\u201d If the current FTC decides to try again, which it may not, the process would likely take months or even years to complete.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate the FTC\u2019s rule won\u2019t be enforced,\u201d says Mario Trujillo, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cBut, the opinion doesn\u2019t stop states from acting, Congress from acting, or even the FTC from bringing individual cases.\u201d States-level rules already have started to step in with more consumer protections than what\u2019s currently offered at the federal level and won't be impacted by the court's recent decision. For example, California's own version of Click to Cancel went into effect last year and remains intact.\n\nLike many Americans, I\u2019m seeing more and more of my paycheck go to subscription services each month. While some of the services are essential, others are less so. But the hassle of going through the opt-out process to cancel these unwanted services is often so tedious that I\u2019ve put it off in the past\u2014until I see the $20 recurring charge again the next month and get frustrated with myself.\n\nWhile deep-pocketed business interests will likely try to block any future attempts to mandate a simplified cancellation process, a deep-set hunger for change from consumers, fueled in part by righteous indignation, may eventually prevail. \u201cI think, on balance, it is something worth doing that can be done with modest cost to the business community and a hell of a lot of benefit to the consumer community,\u201d says Baer."}, "https://www.wired.com/story/best-amazon-prime-deals-july-2025-1/": {"title": "Not Just Any Prime Day Deals, 279 Obsessively Tested Picks\u2014Even $1,200 Off an OLED TV", "summary": "The WIRED Reviews team only recommends deals on products we\u2019ve actually tested and approved.

If you\u2019re looking for up-to-the-minute coverage of deals, check out our Amazon Prime Day liveblog, which will run from 5 am to midnight daily.\n\nJump to Section: Tech Deals, Home Office, Apple, Amazon Devices, Phones, TVs, Headphones & Speakers, Kitchen, Home Security, Vacuums, Home, Beauty & Grooming, Smartwatches and fitness trackers, Outdoor & Active, Travel, Toys & Games\n\nTech Deals\n\nDeals on laptops, routers, storage, cables, and more.\n\nIf you\u2019re coming to Prime Day looking for something dirt-cheap, I\u2019ve got one for you. Yes, this device is a Chromebook, but as a \u201cChromebook Plus\u201d model, it\u2019s a big step up from the reputation these laptops have when kids are introduced to them in schools. The Acer Chromebook Plus 515 comes with a 1080p display, a spacious 15.6-inch display, and an Intel Core i3 processor. The screen isn\u2019t a touchscreen, but there's good port selection and decent speakers. For the price, it\u2019s a really strong machine if your needs aren't high. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\n\nDon\u2019t write off a laptop as overpriced just because it\u2019s more than $1,000. This configuration comes with 1 TB of storage, four times as much as the starting MacBook Air (or twice as much when price-matched). Even though this display isn\u2019t as colorful or as bright, and the chassis isn\u2019t as thin, the Dell Plus 14 (6/10 WIRED Reviewed) is a cheaper alternative that comes with more ports at a better price. \u2014Luke Larsen\n\nFinally, we\u2019re getting some new ultra-affordable Chromebooks. This new generation of Chromebooks look and feel more like modern laptops, and the Asus Chromebook CX15 is a great example of that. Its bezels aren\u2019t overly large, and the keyboard feels great to type on. Not perfect, of course, but at $50 off the already low price, it\u2019s one of the very best laptops you can buy at this price. \u2014Luke Larsen\n\nWith the Surface Pro 11th Edition (6/10, WIRED Review), Microsoft\u2019s long-standing 2-in-1 laptop is finally living up to its potential. Unlike previous models, it had great performance and battery life to match its excellent design and build quality. A true iPad Pro alternative for Windows users. With the latest Surface Pro keyboard, you can now even work while disconnected from the device, making it the ultimate travel companion. Prime Day brings the price 35% off, comfortably below $1,000. \u2014Luke Larsen\n\nThe Microsoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition (7/10, WIRED Recommends) came out last year, but it remains the perfect antidote to the MacBook Air. Now at $500 off, it matches the RAM and storage at the same price as the MacBook Air, but here, you get a laptop with a larger screen and a faster refresh rate. There\u2019s also a more affordable configuration that gets the price down to $900, while still coming with 512 GB of storage. \u2014Luke Larsen\n\nWant a flagship Android tablet? This is a great 40% discount for Samsung\u2019s best, which sports an 11-inch AMOLED screen, excellent performance, and includes a stylus that magnetically sticks to the top of the slate. The Tab S9 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the smallest of the lot, but that also makes it the easiest to use. It\u2019s no iPad, but it comes very close. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\n\nThe top pick in our Best Mesh Routers guide, this two-pack of tri-band Wi-Fi 6 routers comes pre-paired for easy setup. It scored consistently high for speed and stability, and will cover the average home. You get Wi-Fi on both the 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz bands, with an additional 5-GHz band reserved for wireless backhaul (traffic between the main router and the node). Asus mesh systems are great because they come with free, comprehensive security software and parental controls (no subscription required). \u2014Simon Hill\n\nReady to upgrade your home network to enjoy the speedy delights of Wi-Fi 7? The Netgear Orbi 770 Series (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is easy to set up and use, delivers stable and speedy performance, and offers expansive coverage. A relatively new mesh that\u2019s never been discounted this low before, I think it\u2019s the best Wi-Fi 7 mesh for most homes right now. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nEnjoy simple, set-and-forget Wi-Fi courtesy of Amazon's Eero mesh systems. The tri-band Eero Pro 6E (7/10, WIRED Recommends) adds 6 GHz to the familiar 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz bands, for fast and dependable Wi-Fi. It\u2019s the perfect choice for busy households with many devices and a 1 Gbps or faster connection. The Eero Plus subscription is expensive ($10 per month or $100 per year) but includes comprehensive parental controls, advanced security, ad blocking, and even a password manager and VPN service. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nAs the budget pick in our best mesh Wi-Fi systems guide, the Deco X20 is already a bargain. This Wi-Fi 6 dual-band mesh (2.4-GHz and 5-GHz) is easy to set up and delivered solid results in my tests. It\u2019s not the speediest mesh, but if your internet connection is 500 Mbps or less, it\u2019s likely enough. Each router has two gigabit Ethernet ports, and the vaselike design blends in easily on shelves or tables. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nThis tri-band Wi-Fi 6E mesh system from TP-Link scores a place in our best mesh Wi-Fi systems guide. Easy to set up and configure through the mobile app, each unit has one 2.5 Gbps Ethernet port and two gigabit ports. It offers fast speeds at close range on the 6-GHz band, but was also fast on 5 GHz, and offered a decent range on 2.4 GHz. There are optional subscriptions for parental controls and enhanced security. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nIt may look like a space shuttle, but this is actually one of the best Wi-Fi routers, and if it lands in your home, you can expect speedy Wi-Fi on three bands (6-GHz, 5-GHz, and 2.4-GHz). It also boasts a 2.5-Gbps WAN/LAN port, five gigabit LAN ports, and a USB-C 3.0 port. This Wi-Fi 6E router has been dropping in price since Wi-Fi 7 took off, but we\u2019ve never seen it 50% off the list price. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nIf you want to upgrade your network, this tri-band Wi-Fi 6 router from Asus is tried and tested. It appears in our best routers guide thanks to its simple setup, silky performance, and serious speed. It has plenty of ports, including a 2.5 Gbps WAN/LAN and two USB ports, free security software, and parental controls, and offers a wealth of configuration options. For folks with internet connections up to 2 Gbps, this router delivers. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nStaying connected to the internet when you travel can be challenging, but a good mobile hotspot will keep you online, and the Netgear Nighthawk M6 Pro is a very good mobile hotspot. With support for 4G and 5G networks, simply slip a SIM card in, and you\u2019re good to go. You can connect up to 32 devices, the range is up to 2,000 square feet, and, as a Wi-Fi 6E router, it supports the lightning-fast 6-GHz band. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nA travel router is handy on the road or vacation, and the Asus RT-AX57 Go is our current top pick. This 5-inch, white plastic square is a dual-band Wi-Fi 6 router with gigabit WAN and LAN Ethernet ports. It can connect to public Wi-Fi or your phone via the USB 3.2 port to act as a hotspot. Link your devices at home before you leave, and the Asus RT-AX57 Go keeps your family happily online. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nGamers seeking customizable RGB lighting and a performance edge will love the tri-band Asus ROG Rapture GT6. A single 2.4-GHz band and two 5-GHz bands offer a speedy connection for all your gaming gear. The 5-GHz performance is excellent with the wider 160-MHz channels. You also get free security software, comprehensive parental controls, game modes that boost performance and prioritize related traffic, and plenty of ports, including four Ethernet and one USB. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nEveryone needs a USB-C hub, but this one has one handy feature that most don\u2019t: a built-in M.2 enclosure. That means in addition to having your basic ports covered, you can also pop in an SSD and use this as a secondary drive. The SSD isn\u2019t included, but it greatly expands what this little accessory can do. \u2014Luke Larsen\n\nIf you want something hard-wearing and fast charging from the best USB-C cables, this is our pick and it's 41% off for Prime Day. It tops out at 240 watts and has a tough, braided nylon exterior made from 100% recycled plastic. Anker promises this cable will last a century, and it can operate in temperatures from -40 degrees to 176 degrees Fahrenheit. The ribbed cuffs make it easy to grip, it\u2019s USB-IF certified, and there\u2019s a lifetime warranty. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nIf you hate having to fish around for the end of that charging cable, this Smartish magnetic cable wrangler is for you. It\u2019s an angled magnetic wedge with a grippy rubber bottom and a bit of weight designed to sit on your desk and hold the ends of your charging cables. It even comes with wee magnetic fasteners for cables that don\u2019t have metallic ends. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nTopping our best USB flash drives guide, the SanDisk Extreme Pro offers speed and reliability at a great price. The sleek and durable aluminum case has a loop for attaching it to a key ring, and it's easy to slide open one-handed to reveal or hide the USB-A plug. It comes in various sizes and they are all on sale. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nBefore you get too excited about this deal (it's a good one), know that, to take full advantage of the speed of this drive, you'll need a system that supports the PCIe 4.0 SSD standard. Provided you've got the machine to take advantage of it, in benchmark tests, this drive's results came very close to Western Digital's claimed 7,300 MB/s read speeds. It's worth noting that the 8-TB version is also on sale for $620 ($930 off). \u2014Scott Gilbertson\n\nLexar's Professional 2000x SDXC memory cards have been my choice for eight years now, and the very first one I ever bought is still going strong. The UHS-II (U3) speeds go up to (and sometimes over) Lexar's claimed 300MB/s, and it has no trouble with 6K video. This deal is on the largest (and best if you're shooting video), but the other sizes are also on sale if you don't need the big one. \u2014Scott Gilbertson\n\nThe Nikon Z6 III (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite Nikon mirrorless camera. The 24-megapixel partially stacked CMOS sensor offers great image and video quality, with excellent subject tracking autofocus and support for ProRes video. It's one of the best hybrid, photo/video cameras on the market. \u2014Scott Gilbertson\n\nJump to Section: Tech Deals, Home Office, Apple, Amazon Devices, Phones, TVs, Headphones & Speakers, Kitchen, Home Security, Vacuums, Home, Beauty & Grooming, Smartwatches and fitness trackers, Outdoor & Active, Travel, Toys & Games\n\nHome Office\n\nDeals on our favorite office chairs, desks, keyboards, mice, and monitors.\n\nThe Steelcase Gesture is our upgrade pick in our Best Office Chairs guide. The seat foam is a little more padded than a chair like the Herman Miller Embody, and there\u2019s a good amount of upholstery options. It\u2019s quite adjustable, so you can tailor it to your body, and there\u2019s a 12-year warranty if anything goes wrong. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\n\nIf you\u2019re not ready to buy a whole new office chair yet, but find your current chair uncomfortable, try Cushion Lab\u2019s Seat Cushion. I\u2019ve tried a few of these from various brands before, but the Cushion Labs memory foam seat was one of the few that genuinely felt supportive and cushy. Make sure you use it with an adjustable chair (or desk), as it adds considerable height to the seat. You can wash the cover. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\n\nFlexispot makes affordable home office furniture, and the EN1 standing desk is our top budget standing desk recommendation. It has four memory presets, so two people can set pairs of their preferred sitting and standing heights. The desktop is particleboard but feels nice, and the motors are reasonably quiet. There are a few different sizes and colors you can choose from. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\n\nThis fantastic OLED gaming monitor came out late last year, and it\u2019s already dropped to an all-time low of $730, which is 40% off. And it\u2019s not because it\u2019s not a good monitor. Far from it. The LG UltraGear 34GS95QE (8/10, WIRED Recommends) has the exceptional image quality and HDR goodness we expect from modern OLED monitors, combined with an aggressive 800R curve that wraps around your field of view. \u2014Luke Larsen\n\nThe prices of OLED gaming monitors keep dropping, but the Samsung Odyssey G6 (8/10, Wired Recommends) will be among the absolute cheapest options you can buy. And I don\u2019t mean cheap in terms of quality. With a 360-Hz refresh rate and fantastic colors, as tested by one of our monitor reviewers, it delivers fast and sharp gaming action. It's the OLED monitor most gamers should be buying on Prime Day this year. \u2014Luke Larsen\n\nNot everyone needs a smart monitor, but for the right person or family, it\u2019s a lifesaver. This 32-inch, 4K monitor would be perfect for an office that just so happens to double as an entertainment room in the evening. Because it comes with a remote and webOS software, the LG MyView Smart Monitor (7/10, WIRED Recommends) transforms from a work monitor into a fully functioning smart TV when you need it to be\u2014no PC required. \u2014Luke Larsen\n\nMost PC gamers are still using 1080p displays, but if it\u2019s finally time for an upgrade, the Dell S2722DGM is an affordable way to jump to higher resolutions and refresh rates. A resolution of 1440p and a refresh rate of 165Hz will offer a much more pleasant gaming experience from basic 1080p, not to mention the subtle 1500R curve, which gently sucks you into the gaming experience. You\u2019ll miss out on HDR, of course, and it doesn\u2019t have many ports. \u2014Luke Larsen\n\nThe Logitech G Pro X TKL tops our list as the best keyboard you can buy, and for good reason. The tactile switches (also known as linear switches) feel luscious, and I find the TKL (lack of number pad) layout to be ideal for gaming, never getting in the way of my mouse hand, but not making non-gaming inconvenient. While it\u2019s normally a bit expensive, this sale price makes it an absolute must-buy if you\u2019re looking for a gaming keyboard. \u2014Luke Larsen\n\nLow-profile mechanical keyboards are the best of both worlds, offering that tactile typing we all love without the bulk and heaviness that come with standard mechanical keyboards. It has a strikingly thin profile, despite the fact that it has hot-swappable switches and a gasket mount design. It\u2019s a gorgeous design, and it\u2019s one of the very best mechanical keyboards you can buy. \u2014Luke Larsen\n\nThe BlackWidow is a staple in the world of PC gaming as a go-to wired keyboard. But I really like this 75% layout model which cuts out the numberpad, but leaves you the arrow keys. The hot-swappable nature means you can change out the switches whenever you like and customize to your heart\u2019s content. The white version just looks so clean too, especially if you already have a white theme going for your desk setup.\u2014Luke Larsen\n\nThere\u2019s a reason this mouse has become iconic. No other mouse balances performance, customization, and design in a way that just about everyone loves. For me, it\u2019s all about the shape, which offers the perfect amount of ergonomic support for my thumb. Spending over $100 on a mouse might sound crazy to some, but if you rely on a mouse all day, every day, it\u2019s well worth it.\u2014Luke Larsen\n\nLogitech\u2019s premium wireless gaming mouse is one of my very favorites. It\u2019s a mainstay in this category thanks to its excellent, reliable sensor and simple design. It\u2019s particularly good if fast-paced first-person shooters are your jam, thanks to its speedy polling rate and DPI. I like that the aesthetic isn\u2019t overly flashy, maintaining a fairly subtle design that could fit just as well in an office as it could next to a bottle of Mountain Dew. \u2014Luke Larsen\n\nThe Viper is Razer\u2019s esports line of wireless gaming mice, and the Pro versions are extremely light. The Viper 2 Pro weighs just 58 grams, giving you those fast, twitchy responses for shooters. There was a time when a wireless mouse couldn\u2019t be depended on for that kind of responsiveness, but the Viper 2 Pro absolutely can. The price drop is significant, too, bringing it down well under $100. \u2014Luke Larsen\n\nNzxt might not be known for gaming mice, but based on the Lift 2, it should be. It\u2019s wired, of course, but that should be a given for the price of $25, which is 50% off. What you get, however, is a super-light design that weighs just 61 grams. It also has high-end specs like an 8K polling rate and a sensor that keeps your games feeling responsive. \u2014Luke Larsen\n\nThis handy tablet holder is great at holding up tablets, e-readers, and even a Nintendo Switch. I love using it in bed or on the couch so I don\u2019t strain my wrist cysts. It\u2019s easy to set up anywhere in the house, so long as there\u2019s a ledge or table to secure it onto. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nMost people don\u2019t need to spend more than $50 on a gaming mouse. It might not have the extreme sensitivity as more expensive options, but so long as you\u2019re not an aspiring esports athlete, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll find the speed of this mouse holding you back. Don\u2019t spend more when you don\u2019t need to\u2014and don\u2019t buy any other gaming mouse for this much. \u2014Luke Larsen\n\nJump to Section: Tech Deals, Home Office, Apple, Amazon Devices, Phones, TVs, Headphones & Speakers, Kitchen, Home Security, Vacuums, Home, Beauty & Grooming, Smartwatches & Fitness Trackers, Outdoor & Active, Travel, Toys & Games\n\nApple\n\nPrime Day deals on Apple products and accessories.\n\nYou do not need an iPad, but now that iPadOS 26 allows for conventional windowing, you want one\u2014for watching TV while you're washing dishes or on a plane or perhaps even getting some actual work done. The A16 chip means that this is the only iPad in Apple's lineup that doesn't support Apple Intelligence, which, hey, might be a perk. \u2014Adrienne So\n\nThe M4 MacBook Air (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best laptop you can buy, and it might be the best laptop ever sold at this price. As someone who reviews a new laptop almost every week, trust me: Just buy it. The only real question is whether or not to make the jump to additional storage and what color to choose from. I\u2019m partial to Starlight, but the new Sky Blue option is equally classy. \u2014Luke Larsen\n\nI\u2019ve written at length about why the 13-inch M4 MacBook Air is the laptop most people should buy. But what about the larger 15-inch MacBook Air (9/10, WIRED Recommends)? It\u2019s every bit as fast and thin, and maintains the same pixel density in the display. The larger screen just might be worth the extra $150, especially if you don\u2019t use an external monitor at home. It has a killer set of speakers too. \u2014Luke Larsen\n\nWhile I recommend that people consider the MacBook Air first, there\u2019s no doubt that the Pro model has its allure. While it uses the same M4 chip, the MacBook Pro 14-inch (9/10, WIRED Recommends) offers a brighter and better Mini-LED display, along with awesome speakers and more ports. You\u2019ll have to opt for the M4 Pro or Max if you need more speed, but if you aren\u2019t a creative professional, the M4 should be more than enough. \u2014Luke Larsen\n\nI have a weird prejudice against the AirPods Max. They're overpriced, and everyone knows exactly how much they are. (And the case looks like you're carrying around a bra.) Still, they're beautiful, and WIRED reviewer Parker Hall says they're one of the best headphones he's ever heard. At this very significant discount, that makes them almost a reasonable buy. \u2014Adrienne So\n\nProbably the best trackers for Apple folks, AirTags use Bluetooth connectivity and Apple's special U1 location-finding chip to help you pinpoint their location in the Find My app on your iPhone, iPad, or MacBook. Never lose your keys, bags, or anything else again. \u2014Adrienne So\n\nThere are better MacBooks higher up on this list. Faster ones with better displays and more ports. Most people should buy one of those. But the M1 MacBook Air is a stalwart computer that's continued to be sold, exclusively at Walmart, despite being almost five years old. For Prime Day, the price has been dropped to $599, marking a new low for buying a MacBook. Of course, you can also pick up one of the refurbished models for even less, but when it comes to new laptops, you find a better $600 laptop on the market right now.\n\nJump to Section: Tech Deals, Home Office, Apple, Amazon Devices, Phones, TVs, Headphones & Speakers, Kitchen, Home Security, Vacuums, Home, Beauty & Grooming, Smartwatches and fitness trackers, Outdoor & Active, Travel, Toys & Games\n\nAmazon Devices\n\nDeals on Amazon\u2019s own devices, including the Kindle, Echo, and Fire tablet.\n\nIf you're not looking to go all out on Apple's iPad for your rambunctious youngster, this Fire TV tablet is a great budget alternative\u2014especially on a hot sale. This is best for kids over the age of 8, as it has slightly more mature content and a more advanced design. You're getting great stuff from within the Amazon ecosystem, including games, books, videos, and more, all filterable by the adult in the room. We love the two-year worry-free warranty, especially if you've got a drop-friendly child, and this price makes it a serious bargain. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nIf all you need is a cheap-and-stable streamer, one that shows you TV and movies on Amazon Prime you never knew existed, this is a nice buy. It's a great option for dumber 4K TVs or even an HD TV that may need replacing down the line. We still prefer the 4K TV Max for serious streaming after testing both, but you can't do much better for a budget stick with voice search at this price, especially if you're into Alexa as your copilot. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nThe Amazon Echo Pop (7/10, WIRED Recommends) looks like someone sliced the Echo Dot in half, and the sound quality feels a little thinner, too. But it does come in fun colors and is a little cheaper\u2014especially right now!\u2014so it\u2019s a fun choice for a dorm room or somewhere where you just want a voice assistant handy, plus a little pop (get it?) of fun. It's just $22 or 45% off. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nThe Amazon Echo Dot (5th Gen) looks like the regular Echo, but miniaturized to be a fraction of the size. It\u2019s got the same design, and still packs impressive sound for such a small speaker. It has better bass performance than the previous Dot and Amazon\u2019s other petite speakers. It\u2019s a great speaker for the price, and now it\u2019s even cheaper. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nIf you're an Amazon fan and looking for the best smart display, this is it. The Amazon Echo Show 8 (3rd Gen) is the perfect size for just about everything it can do. With an 8-inch screen, it\u2019s easy to see the weather, follow a recipe, control your smart home, or even join a video call thanks to the built-in 13MP camera. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nAmazon's Echo Spot (7/10, WIRED Recommends) sits somewhere in between being a smart speaker and a smart display. There\u2019s now a small screen on the top half of the device that shows the weather and your calendar or the song you\u2019re playing, but skips other features that smart displays pack. But if you just want a little visual assistance without a full-on recipe guide, I think you\u2019ll actually love this one. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nThis might look like a smart display, but it\u2019s focused on a single feature: controlling your smart home. And you know what? I love it. The Echo Hub (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is minimalist and works great as a hub for your smart home, with no distractions on the screen (or ads!). It has a weak speaker, but it will pair with your preferred speaker to send music requests to it. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nThe Amazon Echo Show 5 can do everything the larger Amazon smart displays can, but with a much smaller screen. It's a good size for a bedside table, though you\u2019ll want to use the camera cover, or for small tables where you mostly want a clock face and to see the weather. It\u2019s a little too small for other activities in my opinion, but if this size speaks to you, it\u2019s on sale right now. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nThe 12th-generation Paperwhite (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite Kindle. It\u2019s a little larger than the basic Kindle and comes with a warm light option, which is gentle on the eyes. It\u2019s got a fast and smooth performance, and overall, it's the best choice if you\u2019re looking for a new Kindle. It\u2019s especially exciting to see it on sale\u2014don\u2019t miss the chance to get it for cheaper. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a Kindle for a kid, Amazon\u2019s Kindle Kids is a child-focused twist on the Kindle. It comes with six months of Kids+, a subscription full of books designed for kids aged 3-12, giving plenty of reading options right away. There are also three fun cover options, so you can pick one out that your kid will be excited to see even when they aren\u2019t reading. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nThe Kindle Scribe (8/10, WIRED Recommends) combines an e-reader and a digital notebook into one. It\u2019s much bigger than other Kindles, so there\u2019s room to doodle on the notebook pages, and it allows for some limited annotations while you read. It\u2019s not a perfect device, but it\u2019s the one I find myself grabbing over and over again since it\u2019s so easy to use. It\u2019s perfect for just jotting down ideas and brainstorming without needing more complicated software. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nThe Kindle Colorsoft (7/10, WIRED Review) is Amazon's first-ever Kindle with a color screen. It\u2019s an exciting addition, and the gentle colors are beautiful onscreen. The Colorsoft has run into some issues with performance and the trade-in program, though. If you buy one, get one without trading in so that you can easily return it if something goes wrong. The fact that it\u2019s on sale right now is a perfect opportunity. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nCourtesy of Amazon Amazon Kindle Essentials Bundle including Kindle (2024), Black Fabric Cover, and Power Adapter $162 $106 (35% off) Amazon\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to get a new Kindle and want a case, then snag this handy essentials kit while it\u2019s on sale for Prime Day. It includes the latest basic Kindle, a fabric cover, and a power adapter (which is also handy since Kindles only come with a charging cord, no adapter). The bundle only comes with a black Kindle, but you can choose from a couple of cover colors. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nAmazon launched a new version of its basic Kindle last year, and while it\u2019s the most minimalist of its family of e-readers, it\u2019s still a fantastic device. I\u2019m a big fan of the matcha green color, and you\u2019ll still get a built-in light (though no warm option) with this model. It\u2019s nice and small, perfect for sneaking into a small purse or bag so you can read anywhere you go. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nThe Fire Max 11 (5/10, WIRED Review) wasn't our favorite when it launched. It's Amazon's nicest Fire tablet, but it was expensive for what you get. At this price, however, it's a solid buy. The screen is bright and sharp enough, the speakers aren't bad, and the cameras are 1080p. Are there nicer Android tablets? Absolutely, but none of them so deeply discounted at 40% off, down to $140. \u2014Scott Gilbertson\n\nJump to Section: Tech Deals, Home Office, Apple, Amazon Devices, Phones, TVs, Headphones & Speakers, Kitchen, Home Security, Vacuums, Home, Beauty & Grooming, Smartwatches and fitness trackers, Outdoor & Active, Travel, Toys & Games\n\nPhones\n\nMobile phone deals, plus cases, charging stands, power banks, and other accessories.\n\nNot to be confused with the Galaxy S24 series, this midrange smartphone from late 2024 has some elements of the flagship phone, but makes some sacrifices to get the price down. In my Best Samsung Phones guide, I say the FE is only worth buying if it dips below $500. Well, that time has come. Performance is solid, the triple-camera system is handy, and it will get six more years of updates. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\n\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra is Samsung\u2019s top-of-the-line flagship candybar smartphone. Maybe the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold7 series isn\u2019t as enticing to you. Now\u2019s your chance to snag the gargantuan phone at a decent discount. It has two telephoto zoom cameras, so you can snap the perfect pic of your kid on the soccer pitch, and there\u2019s a hidden stylus that lets you sign documents and jot down handwritten notes in a jiffy. Read our Best Samsung Phones guide for more. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\n\nThis is one of the lowest prices we\u2019ve seen on Samsung\u2019s folding phone, which tracks because Samsung is announcing the Galaxy Z Fold7 series this week. Still, there\u2019s nothing wrong with buying last year\u2019s tech, especially when you get a massive discount. The Z Fold6 may not be as enticing as competitors like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold or the Honor Magic V3, but it has the best build quality of the lot and sports the best after-sales support network. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\n\nIf you don\u2019t need many bells and whistles but just want a good, well-rounded smartphone, you can\u2019t go wrong with the Galaxy S25 or Galaxy S25+, which are identical in many ways. They\u2019re different in size, with the S25+ sporting a larger 6.7-inch screen, which brings better battery life, too. There\u2019s no S Pen stylus here, but you still get great performance, a versatile triple-camera system, and a promise of seven years of software updates so you hopefully won\u2019t feel the need to upgrade anytime soon. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\n\nGoogle\u2019s next folding phone isn\u2019t far off, so it\u2019s a good time to grab the 2024 model at one of its lowest prices. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold slimmed down the original and made it taller, making it feel remarkably like a normal Pixel when closed. But you can open it up to experience a large 8-inch screen. Its camera experience is slightly behind the Pixel 9 Pro, but it\u2019s still a capable and powerful smartphone that\u2019s great for multitaskers. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\n\nI usually tell most people to skip the Pixel 9 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) because it sits in an awkward middle spot where it loses some features like vapor chamber cooling, which enables better thermal performance on the Pixel 9 Pro series, and the improvements over the cheaper Pixel 9a aren\u2019t vast. But at $549, that doesn\u2019t really matter. This is a remarkable phone for that price, with a robust camera system, great performance, and excellent build quality. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\n\nThe Pixel 10 series rumors are heating up as Google\u2019s next phones are expected to arrive in August, but the Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are still great phones to buy, especially on sale. The hardware feels excellent, and they have vapor chamber cooling systems for better thermals, allowing you to game for longer periods. The cameras are some of the best on a smartphone, and the nice thing is they\u2019re identical in specs. You\u2019re largely choosing what size phone you want, though that does mean the XL has slightly better battery life. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\n\nThe Razr+ didn\u2019t get much of an upgrade over the 2024 model. Motorola improved the hinge mechanism, so it\u2019s a little more durable, but it otherwise shares many of the same specs. It\u2019s still a nice buy when it\u2019s discounted this much. It may not have an ultrawide camera (it has a 2x telephoto), but you\u2019ll still have fun with this flip phone, especially if you snag it in hot pink. Read our Best Motorola Phones guide for more. This price is $100 off, but we were expecting a bigger sale and still hope to see one. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\n\nThis is the first major deal we\u2019ve seen on Motorola\u2019s top-end Moto G phone in 2025. The Moto G Stylus is one of the best cheap phones you can buy. Performance is excellent, as is its design and build quality, and as the name suggests, there\u2019s a hidden stylus embedded in the phone. It also has a headphone jack and microSD card slot. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\n\nKeeping my phone both secure and visible in the car was an ongoing experiment for years\u2014suction cup and vent mounts fall off, my lap wasn\u2019t feasible, and just plopping my phone in the cup holder obscured too much of the screen. Last year I came across the Bokilino cup holder phone mount as a solution, and while I don\u2019t love having to give up a cupholder, the Bokilino has performed admirably at keeping my phone secure and angled correctly. My only regret is not having nabbed it at this price. \u2014Kat Merck\n\nThis chunky device stands out as one of the best power banks because it can supply up to 145 watts (one USB-C port at 100 W and the other at 45 W). An ample 25,000 mAh capacity is enough to top up all your gadgets, and you can fly with this power bank in your carry-on. The small LED display shows the current charge state of the battery, and it comes with a USB-C cable. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nSnag all the power you need to keep your phone, tablet, gaming handheld, or laptop running with this chonky portable charger from Anker. As the upgrade pick in our guide, it is slick and beautifully made, with a handy LED display for stat nerds and a built-in USB-C cable that doubles as a carrying loop. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nNot only do you get 20,000 mAh of battery capacity to charge up your phones and other small gadgets, but this power bank also has a handy display showing a precise readout of the remaining battery percentage, charging rates, and other stats for power bank nerds. We prefer the smaller model because it has a cute face on the display, but the larger version is more useful, and it\u2019s a bargain at this price. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nFor folks with an iPhone and AirPods, this is one of the best MagSafe wireless chargers on the market. The wide, circular base is steady with a spot for charging AirPods, and the MagSafe charging pad allows you to charge your iPhone in landscape for StandBy mode, which turns it into an alarm clock. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nPerhaps the best car phone mount for your dash, iOttie\u2019s Easy One Touch 6 is easy to use one-handed. When you place your phone against the trigger button, the arms automatically close, and you simply slide the bottom feet to the correct height. Press the release bars to remove. The telescopic arm allows you to tweak the placement, and the ball joint makes it easy to set an ideal angle. There\u2019s even a clamp for your charging cable. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nJump to Section: Tech Deals, Home Office, Apple, Amazon Devices, Phones, TVs, Headphones & Speakers, Kitchen, Home Security, Vacuums, Home, Beauty & Grooming, Smartwatches and fitness trackers, Outdoor & Active, Travel, Toys & Games\n\nTVs\n\nDeals on televisions and streaming devices like Roku. Check out our complete list of the Best Prime Day TV deals for more recommendations.\n\nLG\u2019s G5 OLED (9/10, WIRED Recommends) offers the most versatile, striking, and downright gorgeous picture performance I\u2019ve tested yet. Whether it's searing brightness, near-perfect black levels and screen uniformity, refined detail, or fantastic clarity, this TV does it all. It\u2019s loaded for gaming and streaming, and passed every test I threw at it. Some noticed minor banding with select HDR10 video, but updates seem to have mostly fixed it, making this the 2025 TV to beat. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nWe love Roku because it offers a simple and easy-to-use streaming interface at an affordable price, and the same can be said for its in-house TVs. This Plus Series model (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is bright and features good HDR for colors, making it a no-brainer for someone who wants a simple cheap TV. It's 30% off, below $450. \u2014Parker Hall\n\nTCL\u2019s QM6K (8/10, WIRED Recommends) sits atop our Best TVs list thanks to a brilliantly balanced picture for the money. It\u2019s not the brightest TV in its price class, but it\u2019s got enough spunk to light up HDR, good black levels for impressive contrast, rich and natural colors, and a remarkably clear and unified screen for its class. Good gaming chops and an intuitive Google TV interface finish the deal for a great buy. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nSony\u2019s Bravia 8 II (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the most beautiful TVs you can buy. Its QD-OLED screen isn\u2019t quite as deep black or scorching bright as the LG G5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends). Instead, Sony relies on fabulous picture processing for pristine clarity and incredibly vivid yet natural colors to wow you into submission. The TV\u2019s still-flashy HDR punch, perfect off-angle viewing, and handy gaming features complete the package for a glorious ride. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nThis QLED stunner (9/10, WIRED Recommends) has some of the brightest backlighting we\u2019ve ever tested for a truly cinematic viewing experience. The only downside is a lack of HDMI 2.1 compatibility, with only two of the four HDMI ports providing modern features like 4K gaming at 120 Hz. However, if it's a vibrant yet incredibly poised and clear picture you're after, this one is worth the splurge. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nPanasonic\u2019s return to the U.S. market was special thanks to the Z95A OLED TV (9/10, WIRED Recommends), which uses LG\u2019s MLA panel and Panasonic color grading to thrilling results. Colors look vivid yet natural, even for sitcoms and movies. Brightness is among the best we\u2019ve tested, black levels are oily, and everything you watch just pops. This is its lowest price ever. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nIf you\u2019re after a premium screen with a bit more pop and punch than your average OLED, the QN90D (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is a hot contender. This QLED TV offers fabulous picture processing for excellent clarity, accurate yet intense colors, and knockout brightness to bust through even your sunniest viewing parties. Its off-axis viewing is just OK, but its mini LED backlight does a good job of creating crisp images and deep blacks. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nLike its Samsung rival, the S90D (9/10, WIRED Recommends), LG\u2019s lovely C4 OLED (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite TVs, now at around half its launch price. That means if you\u2019ve been holding out for its fabulous contrast and black levels, punchy brightness, natural and expansive colors, and excellent gaming chops (including four full-bandwidth HDMI ports), now is your moment. This TV is just way too good to be this cheap. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nThe price of Samsung\u2019s luscious S90D (9/10, WIRED Recommends) has been fluctuating for months, but at around half its debut cost, you can\u2019t lose. This TV\u2019s only real flaw is a lack of Dolby Vision HDR support. It serves up OLED\u2019s infinite contrast in style with deep black levels, excellent clarity and upscaling, and bright, vibrant colors that bring everything to life. It adds four full-bandwidth HDMI ports for sweet gaming spoils. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nSamsung\u2019s flagship S95D OLED TV (8/10, WIRED Recommends) carves out its niche with a unique matte-like display. While this can slightly soften black levels in certain lighting, it\u2019s a game-changer for bright rooms, effectively neutralizing glare even from direct reflections. Beyond its anti-glare prowess, the TV dazzles with eye-searing brightness, rich and vibrant colors, superb image processing, and a wealth of features, including a built-in cloud gaming hub. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nTCL's QM7K had some odd quirks when I first evaluated it, including off colors that tended to turn black images into green (who knew there were so many green leather jackets?). The issue was fixed with a firmware update, which makes this a pretty tempting buy, especially at this price. Using TCL's new Precise Dimming tech, the TV provides almost OLED-level shades of black and blooming reduction, while still getting fiery bright. It's also got plenty of great features, including a 144-Hz refresh rate for gaming, making it worth real consideration on super sale.\n\nI bought this basic stand with wheels on an early Prime Day deal last weekend and attached it to a cheap TCL TV (check out our recommendations here), primarily so my husband could watch his sports outside on the deck without disturbing the rest of the house. However, I found this setup to be surprisingly enjoyable myself, and was impressed with how sturdy the stand was. It even has little stoppers to keep it from rolling around, and a table for a remote or cable box. \u2014Kat Merck\n\nThe Roku Ultra is the ultimate Roku. It features support for Dolby Vision and a wired Ethernet port for the fastest streaming, and the included remote comes with a 3.5 mm port, so you can plug in headphones and still watch your big screen. \u2014Parker Hall\n\nThe Roku 4K streaming stick is the highest-end Roku stick, which means you get all the same great apps but also a voice remote and support for Dolby Vision HDR. That makes this the best way to watch the latest shows and movies on your TV. I like that Roku has some of the best app support around, meaning you\u2019ll never struggle to stream as long as you have good Wi-Fi. \u2014Parker Hall\n\nJump to Section: Tech Deals, Home Office, Apple, Amazon Devices, Phones, TVs, Headphones & Speakers, Kitchen, Home Security, Vacuums, Home, Beauty & Grooming, Smartwatches and fitness trackers, Outdoor & Active, Travel, Toys & Games\n\nHeadphones & Speakers\n\nDeals on audio devices, including headphones, earbuds, soundbars, bookshelf speakers, microphones, and earplugs.\n\nIf you\u2019re still under the impression that noise-canceling earbuds cost hundreds of dollars, welcome to the weird world of 2025 where they\u2019re basically free. These wireless buds provide clear sound, noise canceling that targets low frequencies, and even a helpful app with features like EQ presets and multi-point pairing, all for less than a takeout dinner for two. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nThis is a great deal at 45% off our longtime go-to choice for the best wireless headphones. Sony\u2019s illustrious WH-1000XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) were recently upgraded to the pricey but potent XM6 (9/10, WIRED Recommends). For savvy shoppers, that spells a sweet deal on the previous pair, and I was happy to see a sizable price drop for Prime Day. These headphones still offer some of the best sound, noise canceling, and features available, in a slick matte package that\u2019s ready to travel. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nSony\u2019s hallowed WH-1000XM4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) headphones have been bouncing up and down in price since the XM5 was released. Now there\u2019s an even better, noise-eviscerating version in the WH-1000XM6 (9/10, WIRED Recommends). Here\u2019s the thing, though: these are still incredible headphones with great noise canceling, comfort, features, and sound. You wouldn\u2019t want to pay full price, but buying the dip on some of the best wireless headphones ever is always a savvy move. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nSennheiser\u2019s HD 660S2 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) are bona fide audiophile headphones that pay uncommon attention to the low end. The bass response is rich, buttery, and natural, while the warm yet clear top end provides pristine detail for a brilliant accompaniment across your catalog. You\u2019ll want a solid headphone amp and the fit can be a little tight, but these headphones serve as a statement piece that\u2019s well worth considering on sale. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nGoogle\u2019s Pixel Buds Pro 2 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are essentially AirPods Pro for Android. They work amazingly well, with great noise canceling, good mics, and excellent sound quality. I like that they\u2019re a bit smaller other models, which makes them fit well in everybody\u2019s ears. \u2014Parker Hall\n\nOur reviewer did not love the AirPods 4, giving them a 5/10, but they're wildly popular and at under $100 they're good as backups or as a gift.\n\nThese affordable open earbuds from SoundPeats are utterly capable of everything that much more expensive options from Bose and Sony can do\u2014play decent-sounding music while allowing you to hear the oncoming F150. Open earbuds will never be hi-fi. Just get a cheap pair like this. \u2014Parker Hall\n\nIt might shock you to hear from an A/V editor, but the Skullcandy Method 360 ANC (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are some of the best affordable headphones we\u2019ve ever tested. They have Bose-powered noise canceling, great battery life, and a larger case with a clip that lets you attach it to bags. \u2014Parker Hall\n\nSony\u2019s WH-1000XM6 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) took on the uncompromising Bose QuietComfort Ultra (9/10, WIRED Recommends) head-to-head for the title of the best noise-canceling headphones and won. It was very close, but still an incredible achievement. The secret for Sony is its pack of microphones and ultra-fast processing that edges out Bose\u2019s response time. The headphones also offer some of the best sound quality in the genre and plenty of features for a premium package. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nSony\u2019s WF-1000XM5 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) are some of the best noise-canceling earbuds around, including impressive sound quality and plenty of features. Their only real downside is a relatively lofty price compared to options like Apple\u2019s AirPods Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends), while similarly priced options like Bose\u2019s QC Ultra buds outmatch them for noise canceling. They\u2019ve been bouncing between $300 and $200 for some time now, and at the latter price, you can\u2019t miss. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nThe Sonos Ace (8/10, WIRED Recommends) offer impressive noise canceling, smooth and detailed sound, and a fit that\u2019s as comfy as any of the best noise canceling headphones. New features rolling out this summer claim to improve their noise canceling and calling skills, while their unique TV Swap feature works great for sending sound from Sonos soundbars. The Sonos app has had its troubles this year, but even as just Bluetooth headphones, the Ace are excellent. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nBose\u2019s Ultra Open Earbuds (7/10, WIRED Recommends) are pricey but excellent. They\u2019re the best open earbuds I\u2019ve tested when it comes to sound quality, while their unique rollable design is comfortable and malleable to keep them on in a variety of situations. It\u2019s tough to pay full price for a pair that never blocks out sounds around you, but at a solid discount, these stylish buds become a lot more enticing. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nThese awesome, affordable AirPods Pro lookalikes come in Pikachu yellow with clear elephant trunks, and they nearly sound as good as the real deal. I love how comfortable the Nothing Ear (a) (8/10, WIRED Recommends) are, thanks to silicone eartips, and the included charging case is also relatively stylish. \u2014Parker Hall\n\nUltimate Ears is a serial contributor to our Best Bluetooth speakers list, and the Boom 4 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of my favorites for its mix of smooth, balanced sound and excellent usability. From its extensive Bluetooth range to app features like a multi-band EQ and the ability to wake the speaker from rest, the Boom 4 is a stalwart companion that shrugs off dust, weather, and even serious drops without missing a beat. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nSony\u2019s SRS-XB100 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is my favorite micro speaker for taking your sound on the go. Smaller than a Coke can, it\u2019s liable to get lost in your backpack, giving the phrase portable speaker new meaning. The sound is refreshingly clear and full for its size, especially if you give it a solid base to work from, while features like Google Fast Pair and 16 hours of battery life make this a no-brainer buy. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nJBL\u2019s Clip 5 hangs in the shower; it hangs on your tent loop or your belt loop; it hangs wherever you do. It\u2019s got surprisingly warm and full sound for its size, a dunkable design, and up to 12 hours of battery (15 hours in its lighter sound mode). While costly at full price, it\u2019s a great Bluetooth speaker in a variety of situations and comes in loads of colors, making it a particularly good grab on sale. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nJBL\u2019s Go 4 is a similarly sweet sonic sidekick as the Sony SRS-XB100 (8/10, WIRED Recommends). Its biggest drawback is battery life of just seven hours (nine hours with the extended mode that cuts some bass). Its best feature is punchy and relatively full sound in a snazzy package that\u2019s well-made and ultra durable. You won\u2019t break it, but you should buy it if you need a great deal on a tiny sound machine. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nSonos has been through some app-based tumult over the past year, but one product that has remained excellent is this Sonos Roam 2 Bluetooth speaker (9/10, WIRED Recommends). The little triangle sounds fantastic and takes a real beating. \u2014Parker Hall\n\nTribit has quickly become one of our favorite Bluetooth speaker brands, with hit after hit offering strikingly good sound for the money. The Stormbox Blast 2 is simply the best value I\u2019ve found for a boombox-style speaker, blasting out clear, full, and powerful sound with enough wattage for even major backyard hangs. Did I mention it\u2019s also a karaoke speaker? It\u2019s a sweet deal at full price, and a must-buy on sale. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nJBL\u2019s Authentics 200 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) speaks both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, so you can swap between the two for multiple tasks\u2014especially handy if you have smart home devices from both brands. Its retro design and control knobs make it as easy on the eyes as it is to use, while its excellent sound stands with some of the best smart speakers we\u2019ve tested. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nThe Bose Soundlink Mac (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the ultimate modern boombox, thanks to huge dynamic drivers, massive bass, and an awesome ropelike carrying handle. It\u2019s about the size of a middle school lunchbox but packs much more power, with enough juice to last 20 hours on a single charge. \u2014Parker Hall\n\nGetting the Wiim Amp on sale feels like double dipping on your taxes; the deal\u2019s almost too good. I tested both the original Amp and the Amp Pro (9/10, WIRED Recommends) with multiple bookshelf speaker pairs, and the performance differences are minor. Meanwhile, the standard Amp offers AirPlay while the Pro doesn\u2019t, adding to its cascade of streaming options, HDMI ARC support, and a potent power supply for a killer A/V entry point. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nClip-based earbuds like these cheap ones from JLab are awesome to throw in your gym bag or center console and forget about until you need them. For $20, you might as well buy a few pairs. They\u2019re decent sounding, and they come with a charging case that is larger (and thus harder to lose). \u2014Parker Hall\n\nIn the world of USB microphones, Blue\u2019s Yeti deserves a place on Mt. Rushmore. This iconic mic sounds great, looks great, and features quality physical controls like a volume knob to help you fine-tune your sound. It used to be good, it\u2019s still good. Be grateful. The black one is also on sale. \u2014Parker Hall\n\nKnow someone who\u2019s hard of hearing? The Zvox AccuVoice AV157 is our favorite affordable soundbar for ramping up dialog. The secret is in the Zvox AccuVoice software, which uses digital signal processing to clarify voices and other sometimes buried audio. Every TV needs a great soundbar, and this one is a top affordable option for clarifying the garble so you hear everything right the first time. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nSony\u2019s oddly conceived (and titled) Bravia Theater System 6 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) surprised me with its fidelity, punch, and seamless surround sound immersion. Running all connections through its potent subwoofer, the multi-speaker system isn\u2019t your typical 2025 plug-and-play soundbar setup, foregoing upfiring speakers for Dolby Atmos. No matter, the sound wins the day, and this thing rocks, bringing you into the action better than any similar 5.1 system I\u2019ve tried. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nThe Beam Gen 2 is a top pick for anyone after a micro-modular bar that\u2019s as pliable as it is powerful. You\u2019ll get clear and expansive sound thanks to its virtual effects, multi-room audio capabilities, and the ability to add on surround speakers and a subwoofer from the Sonos speaker lineup later. If you\u2019re willing to bank on Sonos\u2019 software for the long haul, this is a great deal on a great bar. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nVizio\u2019s latest Elevate SE soundbar (7/10, WIRED Recommends) cuts back on features like Wi-Fi streaming and even a remote, but it keeps the coolest trick: rolling speakers that spin upward for Dolby Atmos effects and back down again for stereo and surround tracks. The multi-speaker system\u2019s frill-free yet stylish layout is great for those looking for serious performance on a budget, making it all the more tempting at a reduced price. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nBose\u2019s micro-sized smart soundbar (8/10, WIRED Recommends) one-ups its rival Sonos Beam with true upfiring drivers for more immersive Dolby Atmos performance. It\u2019s a surprisingly musical system, with a talent for piano and strings, while dialogue is clear across content. Its lack of a subwoofer leaves the bass wanting, but features like streaming over Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and built-in Alexa smarts make it a powerful tool at the center of your TV console. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nRoku\u2019s littlest soundbar, the Streambar SE, is also a streaming device, thanks to the brand\u2019s OS being onboard. That means this is a great all-in-one solution to upgrade an older TV to 2025 streaming specs, with better sound to boot. \u2014Parker Hall\n\nJBL\u2019s excellent Flip 7 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is my favorite all-around portable speaker, but anyone asking me for the best deal will land right here. As noted in my review, Tribit\u2019s Stormbox 2 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) sounds way too good for the money, edging toward the Flip and plenty of others at a fraction of the price. As with other Tribit speakers, it\u2019s always a deal, and a discount just sweetens the pot. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nVizio\u2019s mini 2.1 soundbar provides solid sound quality from the main bar and some nice punch from its compact subwoofer. It\u2019s light on features and inputs, but Vizio\u2019s reworked app makes adjusting settings and Bluetooth streaming simple. Dialog occasionally takes a backseat when things get raucous, but music and movies are both well served, and anything below the full $170 price makes this bar a solid steal. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nJump to Section: Tech Deals, Home Office, Apple, Amazon Devices, Phones, TVs, Headphones & Speakers, Kitchen, Home Security, Vacuums, Home, Beauty & Grooming, Smartwatches and fitness trackers, Outdoor & Active, Travel, Toys & Games\n\nKitchen\n\nDeals on kitchen gear, including coffee machines, air fryers, and cookware.\n\nWe rank the Italian-made Linea Classic from De\u2019Longhi as our favorite $200 espresso maker, a price point where it\u2019s tough to find a reliable machine. This is true especially among machines with a pressure gauge and a fast-heating thermopump. Welp, now it\u2019s not $200. It\u2019s $150. The trade-offs are that the steam wand is a little foamy, and the portafilter is lightweight. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nThe original Aeropress\u2014a brilliant coffeemaker from the same guy who brought you the Aerobie Flying Ring\u2014remains part of my coffee-making rotation even after a decade and many fancier devices. You fill it with grounds, pour over water, and use a plunger to steep and then force-pressurize the beans to get a cup that\u2019s not quite espresso but not quite coffee and thoroughly delicious with minimum effort and cleaning. This Prime Day price of $28 is the lowest I have ever seen it and a full 30% off the regular price. \u2014Martin Cizmar\n\nThe Bruvi BV-01 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is my favorite pod coffee machine. The design is cute and the coffee pods brew a respectable cup. They\u2019re also biodegradable. The large touchscreen and companion app let you customize and schedule your coffee, and brewing is fast at under one minute. This bundle comes with 20 coffee and espresso pods to get you started\u2014make sure you clip the coupon to get $150 off. \u2014Louryn Strampe\n\nThe Oxo Brew is the best grinder I know at this price range, which is 30% lower than normal right now. It might not be your pick for espresso: the 15-grind setting doesn\u2019t offer fine enough distinctions. For that, get the Baratza ESP. But for Aeropress, drip, or French Press? This is the lowest-cost grinder that\u2019ll give you good extraction and an even grind, and it\u2019s even cheaper right now. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nThis is about the lowest price you can expect to find this year, or any future year, on what may be the top-selling espresso machine in the world. Breville\u2019s Barista Express is already the Goldilocks Breville when weighing cost and value among powerful, precise semiautomatic machines we recommend as the best in the game. It\u2019ll grind your beans, push out balanced shots, and froth your milk to boot, with few hitches and a long track record. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nNo one quite expected Ninja\u2019s first foray into espresso would go so well.But here we are. This Ninja Luxe Cafe Premier (7/10, WIRED Recommends) impressed WIRED reviewer Tyler Shane, sold out repeatedly, and found its way into my favorite automated latte and espresso machines. This is the first time the Cafe Luxe has ever been available at a discount. Enjoy it while you can. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nThis semiautomatic De\u2019Longhi La Specialista Arte Evo (6/10, WIRED Reviewed) comes with a built-in burr grinder and frother and makes great espresso right out of the box. At this steep discount price, it has two perks over the Barista Express, also on sale for Prime Day. One is a cold brew function best used with milk, and the other is an extra-slim profile less than a food wide. That said, the portafilter needs a plastic adapter and the espresso cup needs a stand. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nThe Instant Pot Pro Plus (8/10, WIRED Recommends), is a thoughtfully designed and capable multi-cooker, still our favorite multicooker WIRED has tested. Sure it\u2019s \u201csmart,\u201d meaning it has an app. But it\u2019s also smart, filled with thoughtful touches like a flat bottom, interior handles, higher wattage, and preprogrammed pressure release. It\u2019s nice. And around 30% off. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nThis isn\u2019t the best, or the biggest, or the most versatile air fryer. But this Dash Tasti-Crisp is so small, so easy to tuck away, and so low-priced during Prime Day that it\u2019s barely even a decision anymore\u2014and former WIRED reviewer Brenda Stolyar has sworn by it for years without trouble. This ridiculously low price is a zero-commitment way to get crisp fries and chicken. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nBreville makes the best all-purpose ovens in the game. The excellent Breville Joule Smart Oven Air Fryer tops our list of the best toaster ovens, but is also one of the best air fryers. As a result, I haven\u2019t used my range oven all year. This Pro model is pretty much the same hardware as the Joule, minus a few (nifty) autopilot functions. But on sale for Prime Day, it\u2019s nearly $200 less than list price for the Joule. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nI mentioned Dimpola's rattan proofing baskets as an example of long-lasting wooden cookware in my review of KitchenAid\u2019s Evergreen Stand Mixer (7/10, WIRED Review), as I\u2019ve been using them for years. It looks like they now come with fabric liners for wetter doughs (mine didn\u2019t back in the day), but I definitely recommend going without the liner for standard-hydration formulas, since the coiled design leaves a cool swirl design on the finished boule. \u2014Kat Merck\n\nFood processors don\u2019t have to be big or complicated or even powerful to be useful. Most of the dumb little cutting I do is of the half-onion or \u201ctoo many little pieces of carrot\u201d variety. This low-cost Hamilton Beach veggie chopper, on sale for double-cheap during Prime Day, is an old favorite of multiple WIRED staffers because it is tiny and it solves tiny but persistent problems. Which is to say, it dices an onion. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nThe Nama J2 Cold Press Juicer is my top-rated juicer. It felt revolutionary when it came out a couple of years ago, and it is still the best. Press the button and then forget about it. It\u2019s pretty and effective, chewing through carrots or spinach or soft berries to make nutrient-rich, tasty juice. It also makes sorbet. Slow juicers aren\u2019t cheap, but this is the cheapest I\u2019ve seen for this model. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nThe Typhur Dome 2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is such a terrific air fryer\u2014significantly faster and crisper than all I\u2019ve tried, with tight temp control and useful self-cleaning\u2014that it caused a fight in the WIRED Reviews team about whether the Typhur's $400 price tag could even be called expensive. Well, you don\u2019t have to find out. It\u2019s on sale for way less than that for Prime Day. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nThis isn\u2019t the best, or the biggest, or the most versatile air fryer. But this Dash Tasti-Crisp is so small, so easy to tuck away, and so low-priced during Prime Day that it\u2019s barely even a decision anymore\u2014and former WIRED reviewer Brenda Stolyar has sworn by it for years without trouble. This ridiculously low price is a zero-commitment way to get crisp fries and chicken. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nI didn\u2019t used to be the guy who makes steaks in an air fryer. But the Dreo Chefmaker Combi Fryer is the best air fryer for roasts, steaks, and chops precisely because it\u2019s no ordinary air fryer. It has steam cooking, and a temperature probe, and smart programs that\u2019ll take meat up to temp, then sear the heck out of it at high temp but leave it pink in the middle. It\u2019s fun. And way cheap during Prime Day. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nI cook with the Our Place Always Pan 2.0 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) nearly every time I make a meal. The nontoxic nonstick surface and sloped edges make this pan suitable for almost everything, from frying eggs to one-pot pastas to steaming veggies and searing burgers. It includes a spoon, basket, and lid, and it comes in cute colors, too. \u2014Louryn Strampe\n\nDeep-dish Detroit-style pizza has seen a surge in popularity of late\u2014I live in a small town in Southwest Washington and even we have had several Detroit-style joints pop up in the past year. If you want to see what the fuss is all about by making it yourself, Lloyd is the brand of pan you want for both longevity and those famed extra-crispy edges. Just make sure your recipe doesn\u2019t skimp on the oil. \u2014Kat Merck\n\nThe Meater Pro XL is the mega-sized version of a smart thermometer I\u2019m testing for gifts for dads, coming with four separate probes so you can fill your whole smoker with various cuts or get precise reads on the various parts of a large cut like a brisket. The app is super intuitive and with prices of premium cuts of beef having soared, it\u2019s a wise investment if you\u2019re feeding a family and don\u2019t want to risk carving up overcooked slop. Prime Day brings a $75 discount, 21% below normal. \u2014Martin Cizmar\n\nJump to Section: Tech Deals, Home Office, Apple, Amazon Devices, Phones, TVs, Headphones & Speakers, Kitchen, Home Security, Vacuums, Home, Beauty & Grooming, Smartwatches and fitness trackers, Outdoor & Active, Travel, Toys & Games\n\nHome Security\n\nDeals on security cameras and smart locks. Plus, pet cameras.\n\nPerhaps the ideal outdoor security camera for Google households, the Nest Cam Outdoor has a handy magnetic mount and an expansive 130-degree field of view, and captures sharp 1080p video with HDR and night vision. It also sports a clear speaker and microphone. You only get three hours of free event history, but you can add a Nest Aware subscription ($8 a month, or $80 for the whole year) to get 30 days of event history and face recognition. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nThis two-camera kit comes with a home hub, and it\u2019s the upgrade pick for folks seeking a local, subscription-free system in our best outdoor security cameras guide. The EufyCam 3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) has built-in solar, up to 4K video resolution, and 16 GB of local storage (expandable up to 16 TB) on the connected HomeBase 3 hub. You also get on-device people, pets, and vehicle recognition, and this system can even recognize familiar faces. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nSecurity cameras with floodlights are great for your garage or backyard, since motion triggers light and color video. The E340 is a dual-lens camera with a 3K wide-angle lens and a 2K telephoto lens for up to 8x zoom to capture details up to 50 feet away. Adjustable light panels provide up to 2,000 lumens. It also pans 360 degrees and tilts 120 degrees, and records locally to a microSD card or to a HomeBase 3 (both sold separately). \u2014Simon Hill\n\nFor busy spots (like back doors and side passages), a hardwired camera can save you a lot of charging. One of the best outdoor security cameras I\u2019ve tested, the Tapo C325WB has a large aperture and image sensor to enable color nighttime footage without a spotlight. It also has a motion-triggered spotlight. You can filter for people, pets, or vehicles, set up private zones in the Tapo app, and insert microSD cards for local recordings. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nThis outdoor camera records video at up to 2K and 30 frames per second, has a 150-degree field of view, and connects directly to your Wi-Fi. The Tapo app detects motion (person, pet, vehicle) and enables you to set activity zones and privacy zones. Slip a microSD card in for local recording or subscribe to Tapo Care for 30-day video cloud storage. It lacks HDR but is still a top camera and runner-up in our best outdoor security cameras guide. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nThis versatile, pan-and-tilt camera is ideal if you want a hands-off device. The built-in solar panel keeps the battery topped off. The camera features a dual-lens system with a main lens that boasts a 135-degree field of view and records sharp video, paired with a telephoto lens that offers 3x zoom in the center of the frame (it goes up to 8x hybrid zoom). There\u2019s also 8 GB of storage built in to keep things local. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nOffering everything you want, including crisp 2K video at 24 frames per second, two-way audio, and a compact design that includes a privacy shutter, this is the upgrade pick in our best indoor security cameras guide and it\u2019s no wonder. The Arlo app is swift to load, offers excellent notifications, and supports two-factor authentication, so you can log in with your fingerprint or face, phone permitting. We\u2019ve seen discounts before but never this low. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nArlo ticks all the boxes with crisp 2K video, a wide 160-degree field of view, two-way audio, and direct Wi-Fi connection, and the Pro 5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) tops our best outdoor security cameras guide. The Arlo app is swift to load, offers rich notifications, and supports two-factor authentication. The catch is a pricey subscription for subject recognition, smart alerts, and cloud storage. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nThis incredibly versatile device is one of the best indoor security cameras, with a dual-lens design combining a regular 4K camera with a 130-degree field of view and 2K telephoto lens that supports 3x optical zoom. You can also pan 360 degrees and tilt 75 degrees. There\u2019s AI tracking with up to four preset positions, plus privacy mode, two-way audio, and onboard AI to detect people, pets, and sounds. Record locally with a microSD card or HomeBase 3 (both sold separately). \u2014Simon Hill\n\nCompact and affordable, with an IP66 rating, this security camera can be used indoors or out, though it does have to be plugged in. The starlight sensor enables color night vision. It also offers smart detection (people, pets, and vehicles), up to 2K resolution, and slightly laggy two-way audio. You can record locally on a microSD card or subscribe for cloud storage. This versatile device also has a magnetic mount and tiny dual spotlights. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nThis is my favorite budget smart lock now that there\u2019s a hub you can pair with it for a mere $20. Aqara\u2019s Smart Lock U50 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a great-looking lock that\u2019s affordable, high quality, and works well. Even when my hub disconnected, the U50 never faltered with remembering codes or auto-locking. I only gave it a 7 originally due to the expensive hub. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nYale\u2019s Assure Lock 2 has been on my front door for about a month now, and my whole house has been pretty happy with it. I\u2019m a fan of the fingerprint reader, which responds quickly to my touch, while my husband likes using the code entry. It\u2019s a full lock replacement that puts a keypad on the front of your door, and there are versions with and without a classic keyhole (and included key to match it). \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nMy favorite gadget in my smart home-filled house is easily my smart garage door opener. I can get alerts when we leave the garage open, easily check if I closed it, and hit the button to open or close it from my phone as needed. Mine is the Chamberlain MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener (8/10, WIRED Recommends), which was installed by a professional, but there\u2019s also a DIY controller that's also on sale you can add onto existing garages for a similar experience. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nI\u2019m a big fan of the MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener (8/10, WIRED Recommends), so it\u2019s no surprise I like the video doorbell to go with it. The keypad makes it easy to control your garage without needing a phone, making it similar to a smart lock. It does require mounting outside of your home. You can get video feed from it too, though you\u2019ll want a Wi-Fi extender very close by. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nI just started testing this mini pet camera from Furbo, and I\u2019m liking it a lot. It can be mounted, plus it has two-way audio, smart alerts, and video recaps. It also uses Furbo Nanny\u2014an AI-powered system that watches over your pet with real-time alerts and smart insights, notifying when there\u2019s unusual activity or emergencies. At a ridiculously cheap price of $25, this is the lowest price we\u2019ve ever seen for this smart pet cam. \u2014Molly Higgins\n\nThis is an interactive robot toy and pet camera on wheels with a 2K HD camera, two-way audio, and a laser toy. You control the robot's movements from your phone's app, where you can view footage and virtually \u201cplay\u201d with your pets. This li\u2019l guy is super lightweight and easily traverses around furniture and household objects, all while keeping your home secure and entertaining/intriguing your pets. \u2014Molly Higgins\n\nJump to Section: Tech Deals, Home Office, Apple, Amazon Devices, Phones, TVs, Headphones & Speakers, Kitchen, Home Security, Vacuums, Home, Beauty & Grooming, Smartwatches and fitness trackers, Outdoor & Active, Travel, Toys & Games\n\nVacuums\n\nDeals on our favorite Dyson stick vacuums and the best robot vacuums\n\nThis is a solid, basic Dyson vacuum. It was Dyson\u2019s previous entry-level vacuum before the Digital Slim (our current budget pick), and while it\u2019s not the most recent model, it\u2019s still a great vacuum to get on a budget. It\u2019s still plenty powerful on carpet and hard flooring, and comes with three accessories and two power modes. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nLooking for a Dyson dupe? WIRED reviewer Adrienne So\u2019s husband thought this stick vacuum was a Dyson when he saw her using it, but it\u2019s actually the Shark PowerDetect (8/10, WIRED Recommends). While it\u2019s not quite as high-quality as a Dyson, it\u2019s still a great stick vacuum that cleans well, has a self-emptying docking station, and comes with lots of accessories. It\u2019s worth the price\u2014especially at this sale price. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nOur favorite Dyson vacuum is the V15 Detect, and the V15 Detect Plus is on sale right now. The difference is the attachments: both come with four attachments, but instead of a combination tool, the Plus comes with a dusting brush. Both come with a Digital Motorbar cleaner head and Fluffy Optic Cleaner head, along with a crevice tool. It\u2019s a great vacuum and one of the best purchases this Prime Day. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nOur favorite of Dyson\u2019s upright vacuums is the Ball Animal 3 Extra, but the Ball Animal 3 is the exact same vacuum with fewer accessories (that\u2019s where the Extra comes from!). The Ball Animal 3 does a fantastic job of vacuuming up pet hair, and it\u2019s a great upright vacuum for larger homes. It comes with a combination tool and a stair tool, plus a tool holder. Other variants with different attachments are on sale, too. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a fantastic stick vacuum, our favorite cordless vacuum is on sale right now. The Bissell PowerClean Fur Finder is the brand\u2019s newest vacuum; the Icon TurboPet is a past favorite, but this new vac is even better. It did a great job on hard floors, carpets, staircases, and even my hair-covered cat tree. It has a bright built-in headlight, plus a couple attachments, including the FurFinder tool that makes vacuuming up pet hair a breeze. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nEffective and smart, this cordless wet vacuum and mop is great at cleaning hard floors. Fill the front container with water and a smaller secondary tank with Dreame\u2019s cleaning solution, and it works out how much solution is required based on how messy your floor is. You can clean laminate, wood, tile, or any other hard surface, and use the vacuum on short-pile carpets and rugs. It\u2019s easy to maneuver and can lie flat to get under furniture. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nI can\u2019t believe this immensely handy, adorable robot vacuum is already on sale. The Eufy E20 debuted at CES this year and combines a robot vacuum, a stick vacuum, and a handheld vacuum all in an adorable, compact package. I had issues with the tiny dust bin and occasional clogging, but if you don\u2019t have multiple kids and dogs, this is the perfect small-space cleaning solution. \u2014Adrienne So\n\nThis is our best high-end robot vacuum\u2014it has a new stair-climbing function, which makes it the only robot vacuum capable of climbing out of our fireplace hearth. This is the smartest robot vacuum I\u2019ve ever used, identifying obstacles and dirty floors with a high degree of accuracy. If I skipped a day or two of cleaning, it prompted me to run it again. \u2014Adrienne So\n\nThe Qrevo S is our current Best Robot Vacuum for having a bewildering array of features\u2014mopping and vacuuming, automatic bin emptying, and mop washing\u2014combined with reliable navigation and a not-insane price tag. It doesn\u2019t have a camera, so it protects your privacy, and Roborock\u2019s SmartPlan also switches automatically between cleaning modes and floor surfaces in your house to clean more efficiently.\u2014Adrienne So\n\nWe like all of Tapo\u2019s other products, like security cameras, so it makes sense that we\u2019d like the company\u2019s effective, affordable robot vacuums. The app connects easily and makes a quick, accurate map of my children\u2019s bedrooms and bathroom. It also has an onboard dust bin, so you don\u2019t need to worry about the surprisingly hard-to-find replacement dustbin bags for some of Tapo\u2019s other models. \u2014Adrienne So\n\nDreame\u2019s 2024 vacuum-mop combo doesn\u2019t have the coolest tricks of the latest X50 or the older X30\u2014it can\u2019t remove the mop pads, and it can\u2019t climb ledges. However, I have found that Dreame\u2019s AI-enabled app is one of the smartest I\u2019ve used, pinpointing obstacles and particularly dirty spaces with high accuracy. \u2014Adrienne So\n\nThis is the best robovac I've tested, especially great for those with homes covered in carpeted space like mine. It kicked the butt of the similarly priced Narwal Freo Z Ultra (though it's also worth considering at nearly half off right now) for both cleaning efficacy and navigation, and offers tons of ways to program it via Roborock's stable app. You'll want to put it on the max setting to deep clean. Once done, Jeeves, as my wife calls him, is a killer robo-butler when it comes to keeping the whole house clean in sophisticated style. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nIf you're not sure a robot can do all your dirty work, this 2-in-1 is a great way to spread the load. Dubbed the \"world's first whole-house cleaning combot,\" the Yeedi C12 includes a HEPA-filtered hand vac and stick vac attchments on the same charging console, alongside a solid robot vacuum in its own right. We love the app, even if the robot sometimes gets tangled on cords (welcome to robot vacuums). We like this one best on hardwood, but it's overall an impressive package, now at a great price. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nIf you're looking for a robo vac that's well-armed, literally, this intriguing machine from one of our favorite brands is a great buy right now. After seeing this machine's Omnigrip extendable arm at CES 2025, we couldn't help but give it a shot. It works \u2026 sometimes, but overall we've been more impressed by its AI-enabled smartPlan, including detachable mop pads that easily swap back and forth between vacuuming and mopping. On this kind of sale, it's hard to resist going big. \u2014Ryan Waniata\n\nJump to Section: Tech Deals, Home Office, Apple, Amazon Devices, Phones, TVs, Headphones & Speakers, Kitchen, Home Security, Vacuums, Home, Beauty & Grooming, Smartwatches and fitness trackers, Outdoor & Active, Travel, Toys & Games\n\nHome\n\nDeals on air purifiers, bedding, pets, home office furniture, and more.\n\nMost window air conditioners are stupid: When you install them, you don\u2019t have a window anymore. Allow me to introduce you to the letter \u201cU.\u201d This Midea, WIRED\u2019s favorite window unit (note that this is not one of the models that have been recalled) is U-shaped and so can fold over the front and back of your sill. So you can still have a window and be cool while having one. Installation is slightly more cumbersome, and involves foam. But the results are better. And it\u2019s the cheapest it\u2019s been this year. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nThis unassuming Coway air purifier has been our top budget pick for a while, and for good reason. WIRED contributing reviewer Lisa Wood Shapiro found it can clean a 361-square-foot room with an air exchange rate under five times an hour, its slim profile makes it easy to situate, and filter refills are both easy to find and inexpensive. I\u2019ve also had a Mighty doing daily duty in my kitchen since 2022, and it\u2019s still going strong. \u2014Kat Merck\n\nIn our guide to the Best Air Purifiers, WIRED contributing reviewer Lisa Wood Shaprio liked this Blueair purifier's built-in heating and cooling function, as well as its app and electronic CARB certification, which means it meets the stringent emissions requirements set by the California Air Resources Board. She did find it to be loud for its size, however, clocking in at 85 dB on high. \u2014Kat Merck\n\nShark\u2019s bigger FlexBreeze misting fan is one of our favorite fans for outdoor use, so I was excited to try this smaller, portable version with fun colors and a built-in tank. It\u2019s been a regular fixture on the bench at my son\u2019s outdoor soccer games, and while I love the portability, the mist is quite fine and easily blows away unless you have your face inches from it. Mist or no mist, it\u2019s still a great summer sidekick. \u2014Kat Merck\n\nHandheld fans: So hot right now. Seriously, though, in the past few years, they\u2019ve popped up everywhere, and for good reason, as they\u2019re a great way to cool off discreetly anywhere you need to. Some of them\u2014like this one!\u2014even double as a flashlight and portable power bank. I also like this Jisulife model because it folds down small enough to fit in a pocket, which makes it perfect for hikes, kids at camp \u2026 the possibilities are endless. (And if this isn't strong enough for you, check out Jisulife's Ultra2, which is also on sale\u2014it's the strongest hand fan I've ever seen, at 1,614 feet/minute.) \u2014Kat Merck\n\nYou don\u2019t need to believe all of the wild health hype from shower filter makers. But here\u2019s what this Canopy will actually do: It\u2019s one of the minority of shower filters that actually removes chlorine compounds down to undetectable levels. (Yes, I tested.) This means no chlorine drying out your skin, or removing hair dye. It\u2019s also a nice-looking showerhead, on sale for nearly 30% off. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nOnly a handful of filtered showerheads I tested were actually successful at removing abrasive chlorine compounds down to undetectable levels. Afina\u2019s as good as any of them out of the box, but also had my favorite broad-patterned and soothing shower spray out of any of the best filtered showerheads. The catch?. Filter replacement is more expensive, and more frequent, than some. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nCourtesy of Holikme Holikme 30 Feet Dryer Vent Cleaner Kit $28 $18 (36% off) Amazon\n\nHey, you\u2014yes, you. Do you live in a house? Then you probably need to clean your dryer vents. Like, right now. More than 15,000 house fires are started every year by dryers, specifically due to years of lint buildup in dryer vents and ducting. People might clean the exterior vents when they see lint buildup, but not the ducting, which is why the Holikme dryer vent cleaner kit helps. This nifty 30-foot drill attachment makes a great gift for new homeowners, old-home owners, or anyone on your list. \u2014Kat Merck\n\nThis is a retrofit device to add automation and remote control to your Venetian blinds. You can connect your phone via Bluetooth to open and close the blinds or set up a schedule. Solar panels keep the battery topped up and there\u2019s a light sensor, so you can have them close automatically when the sun is out. For voice and distance control, you need a SwitchBot Hub Mini or Hub 2. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nPura is known for its luxury scent cartridges from companies like Anthropologie, Nest, and Capri Blue, but as we note in our guide to the Best Essential Oil Diffusers, the Plus is the best option for scenting large spaces. I have one in an open-concept area of my home with 23-foot ceilings, and it\u2019s the only diffuser I\u2019ve found that\u2019s both up to the job and offers clean, pet-safe fragrances that won\u2019t set off my air purifier. \u2014Kat Merck\n\nOne of our favorite Govee smart lights, this malleable, diffused light strip works as both art and light on just about any wall. Since it\u2019s diffused, there\u2019s no need to tuck it behind a TV or furniture. You get adhesive-backed metal brackets, screws, and bendable clips, to shape into just about whatever you want. The Neon Rope Light 2 works with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, and you can connect it with Apple HomeKit and Samsung SmartThings via Matter. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nWith a bewildering array of colorful smart lighting for any occasion, Govee is an affordable alternative to brands like Philips Hue. The Envisual T2 comprises a light strip to stick to the back of your TV and a camera to point at the screen so the lightshow can sync to the onscreen action. The color matching is solid, and there\u2019s a mic in the control box for music syncing. These are the best Govee smart lights for your TV. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nWhy not upgrade your home with 100 feet of outdoor lighting, sporting 60 RGBIC LEDs, at a hefty discount? Like all our favorite Govee smart lights, you can choose colors, brightness, animated scenes, and automation in the jam-packed app. These IP67-rated lights are designed to be permanently attached to the outside of your home. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for the best smart bulb kit to brighten up your home, Philips Hue makes a variety of starter kits that are on sale right now. Its base kit with two bulbs and a hub has a nice discount right now, and the hub can work with many, many more light bulbs if you choose to expand. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nAura\u2019s digital picture frames are my favorite part of my house. The Carver is our favorite affordable frame that still packs fantastic software and unlimited photo storage, and the Mat version that costs a little more (but looks gorgeous!) is currently on sale. It makes a great gift and a great addition to any home. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nAre you a father? Do you like your father? This FLIR is WIRED\u2019s favorite thermal imaging camera. It\u2019s also the secret wish of every dad. It affixes to your phone, and it is a map to all the leaks in your life. Insulation leaks! Electrical leaks! Oh god, the possibilities. It\u2019s also a new toy, which is all that adult men ever really want. This is the best deal of the year on it.\u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nThese reliable devices made our best water leak detectors guide because they have four metal probes underneath and two above to swiftly detect water dripping or pooling. Alerts hit my phone as push notifications within one to two seconds, and there\u2019s a fairly loud 90-decibel alarm, though you can reduce the volume in the app or even mute it. Just bear in mind that you need a Tapo hub ($23) to connect these with. \u2014Simon Hill\n\nSmart plugs are pretty darn handy to turn almost anything (lamps! TVs!) into a smart device without changing anything about the device itself. One of my favorite mini plugs is this one from Kasa Smart, part of the TP-Link family. It\u2019s compact and reliable, and works with Alexa, Google, and IFTTT. It\u2019s often on sale for $8, so this is a slightly lower price than we usually see. Great for stocking up for cheap! \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nThe Petkit PuraMax 2 is the automatic litter box that I recommend for most people. It's easy to use, compact, and actually smells great. This box actually smells good, with quadruple odor protection; plus, when it's time to refill with clean litter, the box rotates so the hole is on top for easier filling. At $370, this is an exceptional deal for an automatic litter box of this caliber, and it\u2019s the lowest price we\u2019ll see all year. \u2014Molly Higgins\n\nThe Neakasa M1 Self-Cleaning Litter Box (7/10, WIRED Recommends) has an open-top design that feels a little more familiar for cats who are used to traditional litter boxes. There\u2019s a lot of headroom that allows large cats to move around comfortably, five pairs of infrared sensors and four weight sensors to detect cats, and it\u2019s connected to an app where you can monitor usage and adjust settings. At $380, this is the lowest price we've seen this year. \u2014Molly Higgins\n\nIt\u2019s no secret I love Petlibro\u2019s products; its automatic feeders and fountains are consistently my top picks. The RFID automatic feeder is a game-changer for pets in a multi-pet home. Using a pet collar tag, the feeder will only open for the specific pet wearing the collar, meaning Fido won\u2019t get the cat\u2019s food, or multiple cats will each get the same amount. Usually around $170, this is probably the lowest the price will drop until Black Friday. \u2014Molly Higgins\n\nThis automatic cat fountain is what I recommend for most people. Although it\u2019s not completely stainless steel, it does have a stainless steel top, smart water detection, and an app that records when your cat drank from it, how much they drank, and for how long. The app also sends alerts of low water levels, when to change the filter, and when to clean. At about $20 less than it\u2019s usually priced, now\u2019s a great time to invest in your cats\u2019 health (for less). \u2014Molly Higgins\n\nIf you\u2019re a pet owner (or you\u2019re shopping for one), the ChomChom is an amazing little tool. It\u2019s a Prime Day staple around here. Simply roll it back and forth across furniture or carpets and be amazed, if not a bit disgusted, at how much hair it picks up. It\u2019s beyond easy to use and easy to clean, and the best part is that you can reuse it over and over again\u2014mine is four years old and still going strong. \u2014Louryn Strampe\n\nSince I can\u2019t truly test this one out myself, I called in the experts: my dogs. They adore this bed. It combines all the factors they seem to be obsessed with: a donut shape that encircles them, a fuzzy surface to snuggle into, and soft cushioning to lie on. The anti-skid bottom comes in handy when they paw at it in the arduous process of getting comfortable (more like wrestling with it), so the bed stays put. And to avoid that Frito chip smell, it\u2019s machine washable. \u2014Julia Forbes\n\nThis popular treat-dispensing pet camera, the Furbo 360\u00b0 Dog Camera (9/10, WIRED Recommends) has clear 1080p and color night-vision camera, two-way communication, noise notifications, 360-degree pan abilities, and treat dispensing. It also has Auto Tracking, which follows your pet to make it easier to find them without having to search your phone screen. At $44 with a subscription, it\u2019s the lowest price I\u2019ve ever seen on a pet camera of this caliber. \u2014Molly Higgins\n\nThe inside of this cat water fountain is lit by a blue LED, with a clear viewing window on the side that makes it easy to monitor the water level from afar. It\u2019s also got a dishwasher-safe metal bowl, and you can remove parts of the yellow and white \u201cflower\u201d to create a fountain configuration your cat likes, like a waterfall, low bubble-up, or tall bubble-up. This already affordable fountain is a steal at $18\u2014one of the lowest prices you can get for a solid fountain. \u2014Molly Higgins\n\nThe Snooz white noise machine is beautifully simple. It uses a fan to create white noise, and you twist the fabric sleeve either left or right to adjust the volume. I keep mine standing guard on my bedroom dresser, as you\u2019re supposed to keep it a distance from your bed so that you can get all the benefits of white noise radiating around the room. I live near a bustling city and college campus, so if I want to block out the sound of traffic or a house party, I crank the Snooz up. \u2014Julia Forbes\n\nThis Babelio sound machine is teeny-tiny, but it makes some big (yet soothing) sound waves. It doesn\u2019t take up much space, since it\u2019s less than 2 inches tall. I like the variety of sounds that create ambient noise for when I\u2019m falling asleep, or even if I just need some background noise during the workday. It sits inconspicuously on a dresser or desk, and is easy to take with me on trips. I can afford the space in my carry-on if it\u2019s going to help me sleep better. \u2014Julia Forbes\n\nJulia Forbes Loop Loop Quiet 2 Ear Plugs $21 $17 (19% off) Amazon Circular ear plugs designed for sleeping\n\nThese are my little (ear) buddies that have saved my sanity on more than one occasion. If you too are dealing with a bedmate who snores, lives in a loud environment, or just needs to block out auditory stimulants, earplugs are the way. These guys aren\u2019t normal earplugs, as they\u2019re circular to lie more comfortably against the ear canal. They let in some sound, so you\u2019re not cut off from the world. Rather, you get the most disruptive noise blocked out so you can rest better. \u2014Julia Forbes\n\nThis cheap mattress is a behemoth. It\u2019s 12 inches of dense layered foams, topped with thin layers of green tea and purified charcoal foam, which Zinus promises will help with the overall freshness of the mattress over time as the activated charcoal microparticles block moisture and odor. The densely layered foams aim to cradle and conform to help with joints and spine support, but they are a little firm. At around $200, depending on the size, this is the lowest price we\u2019ve seen this bed dip this year. \u2014Molly Higgins\n\nWe\u2019re big fans of Purple\u2019s pillows. Former WIRED reviewer Eric Ravenscraft recommended the Purple DreamLayer as an ideal pillow if you\u2019re a mix of a side sleeper and back sleeper. Instead of having adjustable fill, you can adjust this pillow with two foam inserts to adjust the loft for your exact needs. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nCheap sheets that are also great aren\u2019t easy to find. The best set is an easy agreement for our team, though: Bedsure\u2019s bamboo sheets. These silky bamboo sheets are reasonably priced and just as comfortable as more expensive pairs. They\u2019re cool to the touch, though not quite as breathable as other sheets we recommend if you\u2019re a hot sleeper. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nIf you\u2019re shopping for a quilt this summer to add a little texture to your bed but not make you overheat, Bedsure\u2019s quilt is a great choice. It\u2019s one of the many comforters and quilts I tested in my quest to find out if you really need a duvet cover (spoiler: You don\u2019t, but then you need a top sheet!). I liked how lightweight this one is, especially since I\u2019m a hot sleeper. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nIf you want to switch to organic bedding on a budget, our favorite organic sheets from Brooklinen are on sale right now for Prime Day, along with the rest of Brooklinen\u2019s Amazon storefront. These sheets are light and crisp, and just a touch softer than Brooklinen\u2019s non-organic percale sheets. You\u2019re getting the best of everything in one set. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nThese are some of the softest sheets I\u2019ve ever slept on. Bamboo sheets are already known for being soft and silky, but Cozy Earth\u2019s bamboo sheets are truly cozy-soft, with almost a jerseylike snuggle to them. These sheets are one of the top picks in my guide to the Best Bamboo Sheets, and well worth the splurge. This is the best time to snag them for 35% off with our code WIRED. \u2014Nena Farrell\n\nThis is one of our favorite down comforters. It has a hotel-like cotton sateen outer shell with that classic crinkly, starchy feeling. The down is fluffy, and it stays put, even if you toss and turn while you sleep. You\u2019ll never wake up with all the down shoved into the corners of the blanket. The All-Season weight is good for both warmer and cooler climates. \u2014Louryn Strampe\n\nJump to Section: Tech Deals, Home Office, Apple, Amazon Devices, Phones, TVs, Headphones & Speakers, Kitchen, Home Security, Vacuums, Home, Beauty & Grooming, Smartwatches and fitness trackers, Outdoor & Active, Travel, Toys & Games\n\nBeauty & Grooming\n\nFellow reviewer Nena Farrell is only a couple of weeks into testing HigherDose\u2019s red light mask and is already a fan. The triple-strap design doesn\u2019t squeeze the bananas out of your head (her words), and it beams red and near-infrared light (630 and 830 nanometers) that\u2019s designed to boost collagen and reduce inflammation. It\u2019s comfortable, cordless, and so far, the battery holds up. Normally $349, it\u2019s 20% off for Prime Day. \u2014Boutayna Chokrane\n\nIf you're interested in the benefits of snail mucin, the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence is a must-try. Packed with an impressive 96% snail secretion filtrate, this serum delivers hydration and works wonders in repairing your skin, all while being free from added fragrances. Regularly priced at $17, it\u2019s now available for nearly half off during Prime Day, an opportunity to stock up on this cult-favorite slime. \u2014Boutayna Chokrane\n\nI swear by Differin. This once-prescription retinoid (adapalene) clears breakouts, calms inflammation, and smooths texture without (generally) triggering dryness. I use it consistently in my nighttime routine and have seen improvements in my dark spots in just a couple of weeks. It\u2019s oil-free, fragrance-free, and gentle enough for daily use without harming your skin barrier. Unlike harsher retinoids, this one is gentle enough for sensitive skin. At this price, I\u2019d stock up. \u2014Boutayna Chokrane\n\nI\u2019ve lost count of how many tiny pink tubs of the Laniege sleep mask I\u2019ve gone through. It\u2019s technically an overnight mask, but I slather it on all day without a hint of shame. The formula is buttery, thanks to murumuru, shea, and coconut butters, and the flavors are more Sephora-coded than natural (hi, Gummy Bear and Peach Iced Tea). Sensitive lips might protest the added fragrances, but for the rest, it\u2019s fabulous\u2014plus paraben-free, phthalate-free, and sulfate-free. \u2014Boutayna Chokrane\n\nThis old-school straightener is like the Honda Accord of hair tools. It\u2019s not sexy and will probably embarrass the teens in your house, but it\u2019s been around for years, it will continue to be around for years, and it will get you from point A to point B reliably and with a minimum of fuss. \u2014Kat Merck\n\nPhilips Norelco Multigroom 7000 Titanium Beard Trimmer $80 Amazon\n\nThe Philips Multigroom 7000 series is a versatile classic among the best beard trimmers\u2014 a beautiful beast with admirable heft and a broad set of guards for every season, face, and beard. The mix of close shave, durability, versatility, and simple, good construction makes it the one I turn to most often, when I\u2019m not testing other trimmers. This is the durable titanium version, available at a nice 20% price break. \u2014Matthew Korfhage\n\nThe Fancii Abigail (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is my favorite lighted makeup mirror for traveling. I never take a trip without it. The flat disc folds out into a large, 8-inch mirror with a built-in stand and three different light temperatures. The battery lasts for up to 30 days on a single charge, too. You\u2019ll never go back to doing your makeup in an awkward, dim hotel bathroom again. \u2014Louryn Strampe\n\nI\u2019ve tested numerous multi-stylers, including the Dyson Airwrap, and the Shark SpeedStyle Pro Flex delivers similar results without the hefty price tag. It\u2019s light, weighing just over 1.5 pounds, and folds up well for travel, coming with four attachments. Shark\u2019s Scalp Shield technology, which regulates the temperature to ensure it\u2019s never hotter than 230 degrees Fahrenheit, is ideal for sensitive scalps. At $199, it\u2019s easily one of the best Prime Day hair tool deals out there. \u2014Boutayna Chokrane\n\nThe Oral-B Pro 1000 is my favorite toothbrush from the company, but at $60, the iO Series 3 is worth considering. The 14-day battery life surpasses that of the Pro 1000, and the motor is quieter and feels gentler on sensitive gums. Plus, the sleek finish looks way more modern on my counter. \u2014Boutayna Chokrane\n\nTongue scrapers are effective for removing morning gunk, coffee residue, and bacteria buildup that naturally accumulates on your tongue. With MasterMedi, you receive two stainless steel scrapers along with ventilated travel cases, ensuring you always have one available. Normally priced at $15, they\u2019re well worth the purchase, even at full price. \u2014Boutayna Chokrane\n\nThis is the best vibrator for stimulating initial arousal. It\u2019s a flexible labia vibe that delivers sensation to the entire vulva rather than just the clitoris. There are four motors to increase arousal and lubrication to the entire region, and there\u2019s even an app for hands-free action. \u2014Louryn Strampe\n\nI keep a box of Emergen-C stashed for sick days, red-eye flights, and moments I feel a sore throat sneaking up. It\u2019s packed with 1,000 milligrams of vitamin C, some B vitamins, and electrolytes. There\u2019s no evidence that Emergen-C will prevent getting sick, but an extra dose of vitamin C is generally safe and can reduce the severity of your symptoms. The orangey taste isn\u2019t awful\u2014some people even like it (I wouldn\u2019t go that far). Normally $28, it\u2019s now cheaper, so go ahead and stock up before flu season. \u2014Boutayna Chokrane.\n\nCelsius\u2019 variety pack is my favorite kind of gamble. You\u2019ll likely score staples like Sparkling Orange and Grape Rush, maybe even Mango Passionfruit if the Prime gods smile upon you. It\u2019s a mix of fizzy and non-carbonated energy drinks, with 200 milligrams of caffeine\u2014derived from guarana seed and green tea extracts\u2014per can. If you\u2019re not into surprises, individual flavors like Sparkling Orange, Fizz-Free Peach Mango, and Green Apple Cherry are also available at a discounted price. \u2014Boutayna Chokrane\n\nOut of the 12 that we\u2019ve tried, Bloom Superfood is our favorite greens powder. The flavors are quite sweet and fruity\u2014my favorite is Strawberry Kiwi\u2014and it has a solid mix of vitamins, probiotics, and fruits and veggies. I also like the packaging, which doesn\u2019t take up too much space on the kitchen counter. Just remember to eat a balanced diet, too\u2014this is a supplement, after all! \u2014Louryn Strampe\n\nLiqid I.V. Hydration Multiplier is the best electrolyte powder overall, and I especially love taking it along to festivals. It\u2019s got a solid mix of sodium, carbs, and sugar, which are the three key ingredients to look for according to dietitians. And with over 20 different flavors to choose from, there\u2019s something for everybody (though I especially love the watermelon!) It makes me feel better while dancing in the sun than plain water does. \u2014Louryn Strampe\n\nI\u2019ve been on a Vital Proteins kick lately, and it\u2019s an easy upgrade to your wellness routine. Vital Proteins is an unflavored collagen powder blends into coffee, smoothies, even oatmeal\u2014hot or cold. You get 20 grams of collagen per scoop, derived from grass-fed, pasture-raised bovine. If you\u2019re trying to sneak in some joint or skin support without thinking too much about it, this is the one. \u2014Boutayna Chokrane\n\nOrgain is our favorite vegan protein powder, and this iced coffee flavor adds a nice kick. You get 21 grams of plant-based protein (from pea, brown rice, chia, and mung bean) and 60 milligrams of caffeine per serving, which is a sprinkle less than an espresso. Ideal for an energy boost after a workout or a mid-morning pick-me-up. \u2014Boutayna Chokrane\n\nIsopure\u2019s zero-carb protein powder is smooth, subtly sweet, and versatile; it blends into smoothies, oatmeals, and no-bake cheesecakes. WIRED reviewer Nena Farrell stirs it into her post-workout treats, and Scott Gilbertson loves incorporating it into his baked goods. There are 25 grams of protein per serving, and the flavors go beyond the standard vanilla and chocolate (think banana"}, "https://www.wired.com/story/petkit-purobot-ultra-prime-day-sale/": {"title": "The Petkit Purobox Ultra is $250 off for Prime Day", "summary": "The Petkit Purobot Ultra uses a camera to monitor litter box usage.

Then, the box's software will determine and log when your cat(s) appeared at the box, if they used it, and for how long. Through the app, you can monitor the usage by each individual cat and see what type of bathroom visit they had. Clover, my female cat, used the litter box about twice as often as her brother, Basil, who usually only visits twice a day.\n\nBeing able to track this is super helpful, because male cats are more susceptible to UTIs, which can be potentially life-threatening. The connected app logs usage and lets you review camera footage, so you can review if anything is amiss or if your cat is going to the bathroom less. Plus, the camera is on a swiveling arm outside of the hole, so you can move the camera to pan to the outside or inside of the box. It basically doubles as a pet or security camera for whatever room it's in.\n\nThis is one of the priciest automatic litter boxes on the market, but it\u2019s a great tool to be able to closely monitor your cats\u2019 litter box usage and more easily and quickly identify any potential health issues\u2014not to mention is a heck of a lot cheaper and less traumatic to an emergency visit to the vet.

My only gripe is that the app could be a little smoother, and sometimes the English translation of things can be a little off. Petkit's fountains are a great way to get chronically dehydrated cats to drink more water. (Both models above are on discount for Amazon Prime Day as well.) And I recently tested the brand's dual automatic feeder with a built-in camera (below). I have been consistently impressed with it, and my runner-up pick for automatic litter boxes (also below) is the litter box I've been recommending for most people\u2014it's $200 off right now.\n\nPro tip: Check out the Best Prime Day Pet Deals for even more discounts on our favorite pet gear."}, "https://www.theverge.com/news/701884/grok-antisemitic-hitler-posts-elon-musk-x-xai": {"title": "Grok stops posting text after flood of antisemitism and Hitler praise", "summary": "X users have pointed out a string of particularly hateful posts on Grok.

Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine.\n\nOne thing is immediately noticeable as I try on the new Galaxy Watch 8 and Galaxy Watch 8 Classic just ahead of Samsung Unpacked. The squircle has taken over.\n\nThe circle-face-in-a-square-case design was introduced last year with the Galaxy Watch Ultra, and it has now made its way to the rest of the lineup. At a glance, it\u2019s the most noticeable change about this year\u2019s Galaxy watches. And I can\u2019t lie, I was resistant. The initial photos and renders that Samsung shared with the press had me bracing. The circular design was iconic! The Ultra was square and squat! But to my surprise, when I slipped on the regular 40mm and 44mm Galaxy Watch 8, the squircle shape wasn\u2019t so bad.\n\nIt was, dare I say, sort of sleek? Side-by-side, the Classic seemed chunkier compared to the previous version of the watch, but not so much that I felt it had fully lost the Classic\u2019s distinctive design flavor. (Speaking of which, the rotating bezel is here, it\u2019s satisfyingly clicky, and, oh, how I\u2019ve missed it.)\n\nA visit from the Squircle Squad.\n\nJeffrey Kim, Samsung\u2019s senior product lead for smartwatches, told me there are a few reasons why Samsung went full squircle for this year\u2019s lineup. It allows the watches to sit flatter on your wrist, and it allows the case to be 11 percent thinner while housing a slightly larger battery. Emphasis on slightly \u2014 we\u2019re talking around 10-20mAh of extra battery, depending on the model.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to take my word for it, but the squircle watches do sit flatter on your wrist, and they are more comfortable. I noticed the effect more on the bigger Galaxy Watches \u2014 the 44mm 8 and the 46mm Classic, which sadly only comes in a single size. My colleague Allison Johnson also gave me a gut check on the flatness, so you can\u2019t accuse us both of having Stockholm syndrome.\n\nI swear, the squircle looks nicer in person than in renders.\n\nOtherwise, the hardware updates are minor. The Classic gets the Ultra\u2019s Quick Button so you can program shortcuts. The watches also sport a new lug system for swapping straps. Samsung has refined it from last year, and the button mechanism is significantly easier to use (though I did lose a press-on nail in the process of trying it out).\n\nThe Ultra now comes in blue and has twice the storage (64GB), and that\u2019s about it. There are no new sensors. The processor is the same as last year\u2019s models. The materials are also the same. You\u2019ll notice more of a change if you\u2019re coming from the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, given that Samsung only updates those models every other year now.\n\nThe bulk of the updates are software-based. That includes stuff like a Running Coach, which grades your ability based on a 12-minute running test and then generates a custom training plan. It\u2019s geared toward beginner and intermediate-level runners, but Kim says you could use it to train for a marathon. There\u2019s also a new Bedtime Guidance feature that estimates your circadian rhythm to suggest an optimal bedtime. Vascular Load measures your stress levels while you sleep. I can\u2019t comment on those features just yet, as they weren\u2019t available for a demo. I did, however, get to try two new software features: Google Gemini and Antioxidant Index.\n\nThe Classic gets a new Quick Button.\n\nGemini is part of Wear OS 6 and will replace Google Assistant. Kim tells me it doesn\u2019t require a separate Gemini subscription to use, though it does require an internet connection. LTE Galaxy Watches, for instance, won\u2019t need a phone nearby to use it, but Bluetooth ones will. Gemini on the wrist can do everything that Assistant can, and then some. Specifically, you can ask it to do things that require multiple apps in a sequential order. It\u2019s hard to think of these kinds of queries off the top of your head, but here are some that I saw demoed:\n\nStart a run that will burn off the calories in a slice of pizza.\n\nFind the best-rated gyms in this area and send them to my spouse.\n\nCreate a 10-minute running playlist.\n\nIn each of these demos, I watched as Gemini did an internet search and then opened the corresponding app to finish the action. These were prepared demos. When I tried crafting my own, things went a little sideways. To be fair, I was in a loud venue with spotty Wi-Fi on demo devices that hadn\u2019t been fully set up with the individual apps necessary for success. I\u2019m reserving judgment until I receive my review units and can test how Gemini on the wrist works more organically \u2014 but I can see the potential, and I\u2019m excited to discover its limits for myself. This is the first time we\u2019re really seeing a generative AI assistant on any smartwatch.\n\nAs for the Antioxidant Index, I\u2019m a bit more cautious. The nuts and bolts of how it works are that you stick your thumb on the LED sensors, the algorithm goes beep boop bop, and you see a gauge of whether you\u2019re eating enough fruits and veggies. If you\u2019re not, you\u2019ll get some recommendations as to which antioxidant-rich plants to add to your plate. To dial it back a smidge, antioxidants are molecules that inhibit oxidation and the creation of free radicals \u2014 things associated with aging and cell damage. Fruits and veggies are chockful of antioxidants! The Galaxy Watches, Kim tells me, are using a combination of LED colors to detect the level of carotenoids in your skin. Carotenoids are the pigments that make carrots orange and other plants bright colors like yellow and red. (Hence why you, too, may turn orange if you eat an excessive amount of carrots.)\n\nYes, give me a rotating bezel on the Classic.\n\nMy Antioxidant Index was garbage. I tried it three times and got three \u201cvery low\u201d scores of 37, 40, and 43. (You can expect to see variance in readings taken in a short period.) I did this demo right after a vegetarian July 4th, full of colorful veggies and a heaping pile of strawberries.

She has a special interest in mobile photography and telecom. Previously, she worked at DPReview.\n\nSamsung just announced its seventh-generation folding phones, and it finally retired the long and narrow Z Fold design that it had stuck with for far too long. The Z Flip is also getting an overdue upgrade to a full-size cover screen rather than the file folder shape of the past couple generations. After years of incremental upgrades and barely warmed-over designs, Samsung\u2019s foldables are finally taking a leap forward with some bold choices \u2014 just be prepared to pay up for them.\n\nWe knew the Fold 7 would be thinner. Rumors told us. Samsung told us. But like with the Galaxy S25 Edge, seeing is believing. Or, holding the phone in your hand is, at least. Compared to the Fold 6, it\u2019s night and day. The Fold 7 is vastly thinner and lighter, and the Fold 6 looks like a big ol\u2019 chunk next to it. It honestly feels like a different phone.\n\nThin phones are in.\n\nAt 8.9mm thick when folded, it\u2019s up there with the likes of the Oppo Find N5 as far as thinness goes. Oppo\u2019s device is so slim that my colleague Dominic Preston dubbed it the \u201cfinal evolution of foldables.\u201d Open, the Z Fold 7 is just a hair thicker than the USB-C port on the bottom of the device. But there was one notable casualty in the quest to make it thinner: S Pen support. Samsung claims that omitting the screen layer that makes stylus support possible helped slim the phone down to its current proportions. I\u2019ll take a slimmer foldable over a stylus-compatible foldable, but let\u2019s observe a moment of silence for the S Pen Fold Edition.\n\nThe Fold\u2019s new, wider format is a welcome change. The cover panel now measures 6.5 inches with a 2520 x 1080p resolution compared to the Fold 6\u2019s 6.3-inch, 968 x 2376p screen. It finally feels like a normal phone when it\u2019s closed. The inner screen is now 8 inches, and Samsung finally gave up trying to hide the inner selfie camera under the display and just put a 10-megapixel sensor behind a little hole-punch cutout. Good riddance. The water and dust resistance remains the same, with an IP48 rating like the last two models.\n\nPhoto: Allison Johnson / The Verge Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge\n\nNow, the bad news: two thousand US dollars. Or $1,999, to be precise \u2014 that\u2019s what the Z Fold 7 costs. With the price of everything going up, the tariffs situation, and the R&D costs that went into this newer, thinner Fold, I guess I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. At $1,899, the Fold 6 wasn\u2019t exactly cheap. But something about the words two thousand dollar smartphone just feels wrong, you know?\n\nBut back to the good news: the Flip is getting a proper edge-to-edge cover screen for the first time. It\u2019s the direction Motorola went when it relaunched the Razr a few years ago, and I think it\u2019s the right one. Samsung uses the extra screen real estate next to the camera cutouts for the time and date as you swipe through widget panels, or for navigation buttons in apps, which is cute. Sure, it\u2019s a little awkward working around them, but I\u2019d rather deal with this and reap the benefits of a bigger screen than be hemmed in by the file folder shape.\n\nAll screen, all the time.\n\nThe Z Flip 7 is slimmer than its predecessor, too, but only by about a millimeter when the phone is closed. It felt like the same phone to me. There are some meaningful upgrades, starting with a larger 4,300mAh battery. The Flip 7 also supports DeX and allows you to use Gemini Assistant on the cover screen \u2014 both features that were curiously missing from earlier versions. But better late than never. It has the same water and dust resistance (IP48) as last year.\n\nA less expensive, but not inexpensive, Flip.\n\nThe file folder screen lives on in a new member of the Flip lineup: the Z Flip 7 FE. It\u2019s a lower-cost alternative to the $1,099 Z Flip 7 at\u2026 $899, which, sure, is less money. But it doesn\u2019t feel cheap, and with a $699 alternative from Motorola, the FE feels a little forgettable.\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m not forgetting anytime soon: picking up the Z Fold 7 for the first time. It was the same realization I had with the second-gen Pixel Fold: the \u201coh, this is how this phone is supposed to feel\u201d moment. I just wish that \u201caha\u201d moment came with a slightly lower price tag."}, "https://www.theverge.com/x-ai/703721/grok-4-x-ai-elon-musk-live-demo": {"title": "Musk makes grand promises about Grok 4 in the wake of a Nazi chatbot meltdown", "summary": "Elon Musk's live demo of Grok 4, the latest big-ticket model from his AI startup, began with high-intensity music and claims of a \u201cludicrous rate of progress\u201d More than 1.5 million viewers were watching at one point.

Employees of xAI speaking on the livestream with Musk referenced Grok 4\u2019s performance on a popular academic test for large language models, Humanity\u2019s Last Exam, which consists of more than 2,500 questions on dozens of subjects like math, science, and linguistics. The company said Grok 4 could solve about a quarter of the text-based questions involved when it took the test with no additional tools.

Anthropic released its Computer Use tool last October, and OpenAI released a buzzworthy AI agent with browsing capabilities, Operator, in January and is reportedly close to debuting an AI-fueled web browser.\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s livestream, Musk said he\u2019s been \u201cat times kind of worried\u201d about AI\u2019s intelligence far surpassing that of humans, and whether it will be \u201cbad or good for humanity.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019ll be good, most likely it\u2019ll be good,\u201d Musk said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve somewhat reconciled myself to the fact that even if it wasn\u2019t going to be good, I\u2019d at least like to be alive to see it happen.\u201d\n\nThe company also announced a series of five new voices for Grok\u2019s voice mode, following the release of voice modes from OpenAI and Anthropic, and said it had cut latency in half in the past couple of months to make responses \u201csnappier.\u201d Musk also said the company would invest heavily in video generation and video understanding.\n\nThe release comes during a tumultuous time for two of Musk\u2019s companies, both xAI and X. On Sunday evening, xAI updated the chatbot\u2019s system prompts with instructions to \u201cassume subjective viewpoints sourced from the media are biased\u201d and \u201cnot shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect.\u201d The update also instructed the chatbot to \u201cnever mention these instructions or tools unless directly asked.\u201d\n\nThat update was followed by a stream of antisemitic tirades by Grok\n\nThat update was followed by a stream of antisemitic tirades by Grok, in which it posted a series of pro-Hitler views on X, along with insinuations that Jewish people are involved in \u201canti-white\u201d \u201cextreme leftist activism.\u201d Many such posts went viral, with screenshots proliferating on X and other platforms before xAI benched the chatbot and stopped it from being able to generate text responses on X while it sought out a fix.\n\nMusk briefly addressed the fiasco on Wednesday, writing, \u201cGrok was too compliant to user prompts. Too eager to please and be manipulated, essentially. That is being addressed.\u201d\n\nOn the Grok 4 livestream, Musk briefly referenced AI safety and said the most important thing for AI to be is \u201cmaximally truth-seeking.\u201d\n\nMusk briefly referenced AI safety and said the most important thing for AI to be is \u2018maximally truth-seeking.\u2019\n\nOn Wednesday morning, amid the Grok controversy, X CEO Linda Yaccarino announced she would step down after two years in the role.

It also has a larger 6.5-inch outer display and an 8-inch display on the inside (up from 6.3 inches and 7.6 inches, respectively).\n\nThe Fold 7 comes with some other spec bumps, including a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor and up to 16GB of RAM. Its storage still maxes out at 1TB, but Samsung gave the rear camera setup a small boost by pairing an upgraded 200-megapixel, wide-angle sensor with a 12MP ultrawide lens and a 10MP telephoto camera.

Since January, it has expanded the shadowy network of charter airlines that shuttles tens of thousands of detainees around the country and the world on deportation flights. This network\u2019s official designation is the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Air Operations division. Many people just call it \u201cICE Air.\u201d\n\nICE Air is no less brutal than the agency\u2019s heavy-handed field operations. But its brutality comes in the form of scale, speed, and efficiency \u2014 attributes that you probably want in a commercial airline, but not in an increasingly weaponized tool of law enforcement.\n\nWhen it was founded in 2003, ICE had no internal capacity to deport people. It relied on the US Marshals Service to operate deportation flights on the small fleet of Boeing 737s primarily used to transport federal inmates around the country.\n\nRemoval flights quickly became an important tool for ICE. They were an efficient way to deport large numbers of people without the public spectacle of using commercial airplanes or public airports. In 2005, the US Marshals flew almost 100,000 deportees on behalf of ICE, versus only 58,000 inmates for the Department of Justice. By the end of the decade, the Marshals were deporting more than 170,000 people every year but did not have the capacity to handle any more.\n\nICE Air is no less brutal than the agency\u2019s heavy-handed field operations\n\nSo, under Barack Obama\u2019s administration, the agency turned to the private sector. In 2010, ICE began working with a company called Classic Air Charter to broker deportation flights directly from charter airlines. During the global war on terror, the company served as an intermediary for the CIA\u2019s \u201cextraordinary rendition\u201d program, sourcing charter flights that shuttled terrorism suspects to CIA black sites around the world. Deportation would simply be an expansion of its government business.\n\nAnd a far more lucrative one, too. Contracts for the CIA\u2019s infrequent rendition flights rarely broke into seven-figure territory. In contrast, charter contracts from ICE would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars every year.\n\nSince then, ICE Air has grown into an operation rivaling that of a small commercial airline. It operates a fleet of 12 large airplanes (currently a mix of Boeing 737s, MD-80s, and Airbus A320s) every day, plus a reserve fleet of more than 100 airplanes of various sizes that it can activate for one-off flights.\n\nICE does not make its routes, schedules, or even its flight statistics public. But a FOIA request from the University of Washington revealed that between 2010 and 2018, ICE Air flew 1.7 million people on 15,000 deportation flights. Using airplane-tracking databases such as the ADS-B Exchange, the immigration rights nonprofit Witness at the Border estimates that ICE Air has flown another 10,600 deportation flights between January 2020 and May 2025.\n\n\u201cThere is no disclosure, there is no reporting, this is by design not transparent,\u201d says Thomas Cartwright, who leads the tracking project for Witness at the Border. \u201cPeople deserve to know what is happening.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nOn board these flights, conditions are often dehumanizing and sometimes even dangerous.\n\nThe official \u201cICE Air Operations Handbook\u201d requires that every deportee \u201cbe fully restrained by the use of handcuffs, waist chains, and leg irons\u201d during their flight. They are denied access to contact lenses, prescription medicine, belts, and jackets. They receive a meal of a single dry sandwich and a granola bar (chips and condiments not allowed), but are not guaranteed access to a restroom.\n\nDeportees allege that ICE Air personnel often make this experience even worse. There are hundreds of allegations of verbal, physical, and in some cases even sexual abuse of deportees since 2010.\n\nSometimes, this abuse borders on torture. In 2012, a woman who was pregnant with triplets began to bleed during a deportation flight to El Salvador, but the crew refused to declare an emergency or divert the airplane. She miscarried shortly after landing. In 2016, ICE officials allegedly used tasers to subdue deportees on a flight to Bangladesh. In 2020, multiple deportees on a flight to Cameroon accused ICE officers of placing them in a straitjacket-like emergency restraint called \u201cthe WRAP\u201d for up to 12 hours at a time, resulting in bleeding, bruising, respiratory issues, and in some cases permanent injury afterward.\n\n\u201cThere is no disclosure, there is no reporting, this is by design not transparent.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Cameroon, I had been beaten with a machete until my feet swelled and bled, and I was struck again and again with a metal belt buckle,\u201d said one deportee in a legal complaint. \u201cBut the day I was put in the WRAP by ICE, I wanted to die. I have never felt such horrible pain.\u201d\n\nOfficially, ICE says that reports of abuse are overblown, and that it \u201chas the utmost confidence in the professionalism of [its] workforce and their adherence to \u2026 policy.\u201d\n\nBut it has no real impetus to change. Public outrage so far has focused on enforcement and detention activities; ICE Air has been largely ignored. The Department of Homeland Security has never provided meaningful oversight for ICE or any of the department\u2019s other agencies, including Customs and Border Protection and the Transportation Security Administration. And no president \u2014 Obama, Biden, or Trump \u2014 has intervened to stop it or even scale ICE Air back.\n\nICE Air has already played a key role in several high-profile deportation cases this year. It transported Mahmoud Khalil to a processing facility in Jena, Louisiana, within hours of his arrest in New York. Over three days, it took Kilmar \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda to two facilities in Louisiana and Texas before deporting him to El Salvador\u2019s infamous CECOT prison. The scale and speed of ICE Air allows the agency to move detainees faster than courts can react \u2014 even, or perhaps especially, in the case of wrongful deportations.\n\nNow, the Trump administration wants to triple the volume of deportations to more than 1 million a year. To that end, the massive budget bill signed into law on July 4th will add $75 billion to ICE\u2019s budget over the next four years, on top of the more than $11 billion it was already planning to spend next year. ICE will soon become the largest federal law enforcement agency in the country.\n\n\u201cOur infrastructure is going to be huge,\u201d acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told Fox News after the budget bill\u2019s passage. \u201cMorale\u2019s never been higher.\u201d"}, "https://www.theverge.com/tech/697594/amazon-prime-day-sale-best-tech-deals-2025": {"title": "The best Prime Day 2025 deals you can still get", "summary": "This article will no longer receive updates.

Its internal email service went down. Students couldn\u2019t log in to the platform where professors post assignments and course materials. Library catalogs went offline. Zoom was unavailable. Every single service that required Columbia\u2019s official authentication service was affected, but maybe most eerily, images of President Donald Trump appeared on some screens across the campus. During that time, the personal data of at least every person who applied to Columbia between 2019 and 2024 was stolen.\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear the full scope of the breach, according to Columbia. But someone claiming to be the hacker almost immediately began shopping that data around, giving 1.6 gigabytes of admissions records \u201cdating back decades\u201d to Bloomberg. And that\u2019s supposedly just the tip of the iceberg. The self-identified hacker said they had stolen 460 gigabytes, including 1.8 million Social Security numbers, financial aid package information, and employee pay stubs \u2014 the result of two months burrowing into Columbia\u2019s servers before finally gaining the highest level of access. Bloomberg confirmed details of the Columbia data it received with eight current and former students; they were accurate. Millie Wert, a spokesperson for Columbia, referred The Verge to the university\u2019s previous statements on the hack.\n\nThese are three politically motivated hacks of higher education, focused on the admissions process\n\nThe hack appears to be politically motivated: the purported hacker told Bloomberg as much, saying they stole the data because they wanted to know whether Columbia had continued to engage in \u201caffirmative action,\u201d admissions policies meant to improve opportunities for groups that colleges had once discriminated against, after the practice was barred in 2023 by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Republican war on affirmative action is part of a broader push to undermine the Civil Rights Act, which is barely disguised as attacks on \u201cwokeness\u201d and \u201cDEI.\u201d Shortly after taking office, Trump signed an executive order banning \u201cillegal discrimination,\u201d which targeted so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, a fairly broad umbrella of initiatives meant to make sure underrepresented groups don\u2019t face barriers in schools and workplaces. In the broader scheme, the Columbia University hack figures as a wildcat attempt at enforcing the right-wing ideological project of bringing back open racism.\n\nThe attack on Columbia is, in this context, a remarkable story. Moreover, it comes on the heels of cyberattacks on New York University and the University of Minnesota, both of which the alleged hacker took credit for when speaking to Bloomberg. In March, someone stole NYU applicants\u2019 personal details, including financial aid, \u201cdating back to at least 1989,\u201d according to Washington Square News. Similarly, in July 2023, someone posted records from the University of Minnesota dating to the 1980s, and those records included 7 million Social Security numbers.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg\u2019s source, these are three politically motivated hacks of higher education, focused on the admissions process and containing personal information protected by law. Moreover, the supposed hacker \u2014 who, if we take them at their word, is working alone and has an ax to grind about the supposed favored status of racial minorities in American society \u2014 specifically sought out information about self-reported race and ethnicity, and has now essentially acquired lists of people categorized by race.\n\nThere has been precious little reporting on the Columbia hack\n\nThe most extensive reporting comes from Bloomberg and The New York Times.\n\nHere is how The New York Times has elected to cover it:\n\nFor those of us keeping score at home, that\u2019s two stories about the hack and its overall political implications, both of which are less informative than Bloomberg; one story using hacked data to smear a mayoral candidate; and two stories jerking off.\n\nAs a result of the Mamdani leak, The New York Times has one of the best leads on the identity of the hacker\n\nZohran Mamdani, as a high school senior, marked himself as both Asian and Black/African American on his college application, adding the clarifying note \u201cUganda\u201d next to the latter, according to hacked data passed to the Times. He is a South Asian man born in Uganda. He did not attend Columbia University.\n\nIt\u2019s not much of a story. But as a result of the Mamdani leak, The New York Times has one of the best leads on the identity of the hacker. The Times identifies Jordan Lasker as the source of Mamdani\u2019s college application (though bafflingly only by his internet alias \u201cCr\u00e9mieux\u201d), and he likely has some idea about where he got it from. Bloomberg obviously has its own lead \u2014 and you\u2019d think the two would be competing to get more information about this politically motivated hack out to the general public.\n\nMaybe we will see some impressive reporting shortly and someone is chasing it right now. Or perhaps there is simply no one at the Times who can report out the story, which now involves three major data breaches. Certainly the handling of Mamdani\u2019s college application makes it look like the Times is either unfamiliar with or unwilling to engage in best practices around hacked materials. It does, however, strain credulity to think this particular newspaper would be unaware of those standards.\n\nHad reporters been played by hackers? (Yes.)\n\nIn 2016, The New York Times ran a series of stories about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, which had been hosted on a private server \u2014 not recommended, for security reasons \u2014 while she was secretary of state. Following a relentless news cycle about her emails, a Democratic National Committee email server was hacked. WikiLeaks published almost 20,000 stolen emails, notably spending October dropping batches of damaging emails from Clinton\u2019s campaign chair. As early as June 2016, the media already had a pretty good idea that the hacker was actually the Russian government, but went all out on the emails anyway. (In 2018, a US grand jury indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers in connection with the hack.) The extensive coverage of those hacked emails \u2014 from the Times and elsewhere \u2014 likely contributed to Clinton\u2019s loss to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, even though the emails were nothingburgers. Does anyone even remember the contents?\n\nJournalists have long struggled over balancing newsworthiness and sourcing \u2014 the 2014 North Korean hack of Sony Pictures produced a spectacular revelation about Hollywood\u2019s war on Google, but also gossip intended to humiliate Amy Pascal, where reporters played along and effectively did Kim Jong Un\u2019s bidding. But the WikiLeaks-DNC emails incident led to intense media navel-gazing. Had reporters been played by hackers? (Yes.) Was there a way to avoid that in the future? (Yes.) Journalists seriously reevaluated how to treat hacked materials, and how much emphasis to put on them.\n\nHackers don\u2019t make journalistic assignments. Journalists do\n\nIn justifying the coverage decisions around leaked materials, there was a common thread: Hackers don\u2019t make journalistic assignments. Journalists do. No news organization \u2014 including this one \u2014 would make a blanket rule against hacked materials. Instead, the idea would be to be judicious about what was being leaked and by who, giving readers information on what the hack was meant to accomplish if the information in it was found to be newsworthy.\n\nThe Times\u2019 coverage of the hacked Mamdani material flies in the face of the editorial decisions around Hunter Biden\u2019s emails and the hacked documents from the Trump campaign. The choice to use the material is inconsistent with previous decisions, but that\u2019s not all. The framing of the story might as well have been dictated by the hacker, who has it out for affirmative action, and the internet eugenicist who supplied the material.\n\nI reached out to The New York Times to request comment on how they\u2019d identified the source and framed the story. Spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha declined to answer those questions, and sent a statement that read, in part, \u201cReporters receive tips from people with biases and bad motives all the time, but we only publish such information after we\u2019ve independently verified it, confirmed it, done our own reporting on it and judged it to be newsworthy.\u201d\n\nThe context in which these actors are going after Columbia is important as well. The Trump regime has come at the Ivy League broadly over diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. It has singled out Columbia specifically, leveraging accusations of antisemitism over the university\u2019s handling of protests against the Israeli attacks on Gaza. Trump\u2019s ICE has targeted student protesters, disappearing them into faraway facilities.\n\nFrankly, we will have gotten off lightly if \u201cMamdani Once Claimed to Be Asian and African American\u201d is the only hit the Columbia hacker manages to land with their stolen data\n\nThe institution has not exactly been defiant about the attacks on its students \u2014 days after the ICE raid that took Mahmoud Khalil, the university expelled, suspended, or revoked the degrees of students who occupied a campus building last spring as part of a protest. This did not pacify the Trump regime, which has frozen $400 million of funding for Columbia University and is currently negotiating a settlement with the university.\n\nThe timing of the hack, given the university\u2019s relationship with the Trump regime, raised my eyebrows. A hacker who is also a Trump follower might attempt to pressure Columbia with stolen data, perhaps via strategic leaks to major newspapers, in order to get it to capitulate to Trump\u2019s pressure campaigns.\n\nWho did the hacking and how did it happen? What was stolen, and where is it being stored? Is any of it being sold? What other schools are being targeted? How will this stolen information place pressure on Columbia? These questions all seem like fertile ground for reporting. It would be nice if The New York Times was interested in that story. But at the absolute bare minimum, when it ran its bizarre story about Mamdani\u2019s college application, it should have made the political motivations of the hacker clear to the reader.\n\nIf it\u2019s true that the Times allowed itself to become the mouthpiece of an anti-affirmative action hacktivist, it is a travesty. But frankly, we will have gotten off lightly if \u201cMamdani Once Claimed to Be Asian and African American\u201d is the only hit the Columbia hacker manages to land with their stolen data. They may well be poised to do much more damage, and at a time when the university has already been brought to its knees.\n\nThere are as yet no indications that the hacker has anything other than admissions data, which is something of a relief, given how much stuff there is at any given university. In fact, speaking of journalistic ethics: even though journalism does not have one single body that upholds professional ethics, The Columbia Journalism Review \u2014 housed at Columbia University, alongside a renowned journalism school and the prestigious Pulitzer Prizes \u2014 is widely acknowledged as a leading institution in setting and guiding norms in the profession. One might think of the Columbia hack as an indirect attack on journalists and journalistic institutions; it is possible the hacker has data that could be weaponized in a direct one.\n\nI am struggling to understand why I can find so little reporting on something that seems awfully newsworthy. Look, I\u2019m the in-house finance nerd at the phones website; I rely on people who know how computers work to do reporting on hacks. But here we have a politically motivated hack of three universities, data from which has been used by the nation\u2019s most prestigious newspaper to attempt a hit job on a Democratic mayoral candidate, and precious little else. I get that we all have hacking fatigue \u2014 it feels like every other week, some major business gets rekt \u2014 but the Columbia University story is different. Is anyone going to treat it that way?"}, "https://www.theverge.com/news/703364/apple-vision-pro-second-gen-release-rumor": {"title": "Apple\u2019s second-generation Vision Pro might launch this year", "summary": "Apple is preparing to launch its next Vision Pro headset \u201cas early as this year,\u201d according to a report from Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman.

The upcoming device will reportedly feature an upgraded M4 processor, along with a redesigned strap to combat neck and head pain.\n\nThe $3,499 Vision Pro, which was released in February 2024, uses a now-three-year-old M2 processor. As reported by Bloomberg, the Vision Pro\u2019s next iteration could come with an emphasis on AI, a move that would align with the company\u2019s efforts to infuse AI across the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Apple could outfit the next Vision Pro with more than the 16 neural engine cores available on the current M2-equipped headset. If true, that would make it the first M4 chip with more than 16 neural cores \u2014 so far, only the M2 Ultra and M3 Ultra have come with more than that. Even without the extra cores, the M4\u2019s 16-core NPU is still more than two times faster than one on the M2.\n\nBloomberg reports that Apple is also testing new Vision Pro straps to make the around 1.4-pound device more comfortable to wear as well.

But under Yaccarino\u2019s CEO tenure, X has caved to government censorship requests abroad while using lawsuits to harass its critics in the US:\n\n\u201cTurning the company around\u201d\n\nOfficial metrics are hard to pin down here, but financial and usage estimates suggest that X is generally on a downward trend. Not great for the person Musk said was supposed to be in charge of the platform\u2019s \u201cbusiness operations.\u201d\n\nMusk has painted a bright picture of X, saying in May 2024 that the platform had \u201c600 million monthly active users.\u201d In March 2024, Yaccarino said that there had been \u201ca 12% jump in time spent on the platform since last year.\u201d But data shared with The Verge from digital intelligence platform Similarweb indicates that X has actually lost a huge chunk of its active user base since Yaccarino took over.\n\nIn June 2023, when Yaccarino officially stepped into the role, the platform had 388.5 million users across its iOS and Android apps, according to Similarweb; as of last month, it had 311.1 million users \u2014 a loss of over 75 million.\n\nYaccarino was formerly an ad executive at NBC Universal, and part of her job was to shore up shaky relationships after incidents like Musk endorsing white pride \u2014 which caused companies like Apple and Disney to pull back spending on the platform \u2014 and telling advertisers at a New York Times event to \u201cgo fuck yourself.\u201d (Yaccarino characterized that last one \u201can explicit point of view about our position.\u201d)\n\nIt\u2019s true that Apple returned to advertise on X earlier this year, and Bloomberg reported on eMarketer estimates in March that said X is projected to have its first year of advertising growth in 2025. But did Yaccarino have much to do with that? According to an eMarketer exec at the time, the increased ad spending is partially due to Musk\u2019s close relationship with the Trump administration \u2014 it\u2019s a lot easier to keep advertisers when the FTC can force companies to work with you. Musk and Trump\u2019s relationship is much rockier now, so the long-term success of that plan is looking increasingly unclear, even if Yaccarino boasted that the platform has \u201cwelcomed\u201d 96 percent of its \u201ctop advertisers\u201d back to the platform.\n\nOne other metric of X not actually turning around? Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, but when Musk\u2019s xAI bought X earlier this year, it valued X at $33 billion on paper.\n\n\u201cTransforming X into the Everything App\u201d\n\nAs I\u2019ve written about before, Musk has had intentions of building some kind of WeChat-like super app for a long time, but the X of today still looks very much like the Twitter of yesteryear.\n\nX\u2019s primary use is still as a social media platform: users are scrolling through post after post after post, perhaps sometimes pinging Grok for AI-generated commentary. Yes, there are new, small features like audio and voice calls and a dedicated vertical video tab copying apps like TikTok or Instagram. But its \u201cX Money\u201d payments system still hasn\u2019t arrived, even though Yaccarino announced in January that it would be arriving \u201clater this year.\u201d After X being folded into Musk\u2019s AI company and losing Yaccarino as CEO, it\u2019s unclear how much of a priority the feature might be \u2014 especially for X\u2019s new head of product, who seems a little more focused on the lols.\n\nAnd about Grok. The bot was updated to be more \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d just before Yaccarino announced her departure, and it promptly flooded X with antisemitism and repeatedly praised Hitler before text responses were turned off. The timing is strikingly awful, even if The New York Times reported that Yaccarino had \u201cdiscussed her plans to leave with X employees earlier this week, before the incident with Grok.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe critical early work necessary to prioritize the safety of our users\u2014especially children\u201d\n\nAs for \u201cespecially children,\u201d the company reportedly has serious problems managing child sexual abuse material (CSAM). While X said in 2024 that it had suspended significantly more accounts in 2023 than in 2022 for violating its child sexual exploitation policies, the platform is also contending with accounts using hashtags to try and sell and advertising CSAM in X Communities, as reported in June by NBC News. In fact, X actually unbanned a high-profile influencer in July 2023 who was removed for posting a still from an infamous CSAM video.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nYaccarino didn\u2019t specify when she\u2019s stepping down from X. Her profile now says that she is the \u201cSuper Official eX CEO of X,\u201d so it seems like her work may already be done. She also didn\u2019t say who may replace her, and Musk hasn\u2019t, either."}, "https://www.theverge.com/tech/698710/amazon-prime-day-nintendo-switch-oled-deal-sale-2025": {"title": "The Nintendo Switch OLED Model is cheaper than ever for Prime Day", "summary": "Amazon Prime Day is the best time to save money on a Nintendo Switch OLED.
