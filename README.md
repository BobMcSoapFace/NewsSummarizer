## News Summarizer
ReactJS + Flask website made for the modern ADHD child
This is my first ReactJS website, so this includes some borrowed front-end React code (https://github.com/fireclint/travel-react-app/blob/main/src/components/navbar/Navbar.js) (but everything else is written by me).
Summarization is made possible by the Facebook pretrained AI Model (https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-cnn).
No AI was used in the writing of this code.
